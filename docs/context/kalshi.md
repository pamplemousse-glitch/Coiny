/openapi.yaml get /markets/{ticker}/orderbook
 Endpoint for getting the current order book for a specific market.  The order book shows all active bid orders for both yes and no sides of a binary market. It returns yes bids and no bids only (no asks are returned). This is because in binary markets, a bid for yes at price X is equivalent to an ask for no at price (100-X).

/openapi.yaml get /markets/orderbooks
Endpoint for getting the current order books for multiple markets in a single request. The order book shows all active bid orders for both yes and no sides of a binary market. It returns yes bids and no bids only (no asks are returned). This is because in binary markets, a bid for yes at price X is equivalent to an ask for no at price (100-X). For example, a yes bid at 7¢ is the same as a no ask at 93¢, with identical contract sizes. Each side shows price levels with their corresponding quantities and order counts, organized from best to worst prices. Returns one orderbook per requested market ticker.



# Get Series
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/market/get-series

/openapi.yaml get /series/{series_ticker}
 Endpoint for getting data about a specific series by its ticker.

Endpoint for getting all trades for all markets. A trade represents a completed transaction between two users on a specific market. Each trade includes the market ticker, price, quantity, and timestamp information. Block trades are included in the response by default and identified by the `is_block_trade` field; use the `is_block_trade` query parameter to filter by block / non-block. This endpoint returns a paginated response. Use the 'limit' parameter to control page size (1-1000, defaults to 100). The response includes a 'cursor' field - pass this value in the 'cursor' parameter of your next request to get the next page. An empty cursor indicates no more pages are available.




# Get Milestone
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/milestone/get-milestone

# Amend Order (V2)
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/orders/amend-order-v2

/openapi.yaml post /portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}/amend
Endpoint for amending the price and/or max fillable count of an existing event-market order using the V2 request/response shape. The request `count` is the updated total/max fillable count, equal to already filled count plus desired resting remaining count. This behavior matches the v1 amend endpoints; only the request/response shape differs.

<Note>
  Amending a resting order preserves queue position only when the amendment decreases size. All other amendments — like increasing size or changing price forfeit queue position and place the order at the back of the queue.

# CF Benchmarks REST Passthrough
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/cfbenchmarks/rest-passthrough

Query CF Benchmarks REST data using your existing Kalshi API credentials

## Overview

The CF Benchmarks REST passthrough lets you query the [CF Benchmarks](https://www.cfbenchmarks.com) REST API using your existing Kalshi API credentials. Requests are authenticated the same way as any other Kalshi Trade API call, so you do not need a separate CF Benchmarks API key.

Send a request to the `/cfbenchmarks` endpoint and the path and query string are forwarded to CF Benchmarks. The upstream response is returned wrapped in a standard Kalshi `data` envelope.

## Access

The passthrough requires an authenticated Kalshi Trade API request, and it is available only to accounts with the appropriate entitlement. If you receive an authorization error and believe you should have access, contact Kalshi.

## Rate limit

Each passthrough request costs **50 tokens** from your Read bucket; the default request costs 10. At the Basic tier's 200 tokens-per-second read budget, that sustains 4 requests per second. See [Rate Limits and Tiers](/getting_started/rate_limits) for budgets and bucket behavior.

## Base URL and Path Mapping

Use the production Trade API base URL (see [API Environments](/getting_started/api_environments) for all hosts and the demo environment):

```text theme={null}
https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2
```

Everything after `/cfbenchmarks/`, including the query string, is forwarded to the CF Benchmarks REST API at `https://www.cfbenchmarks.com/api/v1/`.

| Kalshi request                                  | Forwarded to                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /trade-api/v2/cfbenchmarks/values?id=BRTI` | `https://www.cfbenchmarks.com/api/v1/values?id=BRTI` |

## Authentication

Authenticate with standard Kalshi API key request signing. See [API Keys](/getting_started/api_keys) and [Quick Start: Authenticated Requests](/getting_started/quick_start_authenticated_requests) for the full signing flow.

As with all Trade API endpoints, sign the request path from the API root **without** the query string:

```text theme={null}
/trade-api/v2/cfbenchmarks/values
```

## Example

```bash theme={null}
curl "https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/cfbenchmarks/values?id=BRTI" \
  -H "KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY: <your-access-key>" \
  -H "KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE: <request-signature>" \
  -H "KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP: <timestamp-ms>"
```

The raw CF Benchmarks payload is returned under the `data` field:

```json theme={null}
{
  "data": {
    "serverTime": "2019-08-13T23:30:53.992Z",
    "payload": {}
  }
}
```

## Available Endpoints

The passthrough forwards any path and query parameters supported by CF Benchmarks. For the list of available endpoints, supported parameters, and index identifiers (such as `BRTI`), refer to the official [CF Benchmarks API documentation](https://docs.cfbenchmarks.com/api/category/rest/).

## Error Handling

The passthrough maps upstream conditions to standard Kalshi error responses:

| Condition                                                | Kalshi response                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Resource not found upstream                              | `404 not_found`                          |
| Upstream rate limit exceeded                             | `429 too_many_requests`                  |
| Upstream authorization failure, server error, or timeout | `503 service_unavailable`                |
| Other upstream client errors                             | `400 bad_request` (with upstream detail) |


# API Changelog
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/changelog/index

Stay updated with API changes and version history

You can subscribe to the RSS changelog at `/changelog/rss.xml` if you'd like to stay ahead of breaking changes.

This changelog is a work in progress. As always, we welcome any feedback in our Discord #dev channel!

This changelog covers Kalshi's REST, WebSocket, and FIX APIs across both the
Predictions and Margin exchanges. Use the entry tags to filter by API
surface (`REST`, `WebSocket`, `FIX`) or exchange (`Predictions`, `Margin`).
FIX API changes, previously tracked on a separate page, now live here under
the `FIX` tag.

<Update label="August 24, 2026">
  Upcoming exchange sharding: Crypto, Tennis, and Baseball will be provisioned
  on dedicated exchange instances. Please see
  [Exchange Sharding](/getting_started/exchange_sharding) for changes to trading.
</Update>

<Update label="August 22, 2026">
  **Rollout timing:**

  * Maker fees will be enabled at 11:59 PM on Wednesday, August 19.
  * Post-only mode will be disabled and the quoter fee swap will be enabled at
    11:59 PM on Friday, August 21.

  For combo trades, if a quoter executes against an order that has rested on
  the book for less than five seconds, both parties' fees will be adjusted: the
  quoter will pay the maker fee, and the resting counterparty will pay the
  taker fee. See the [Kalshi Fee Schedule](https://kalshi.com/docs/kalshi-fee-schedule.pdf)
  for details.
</Update>

<Update label="August 20, 2026">
  `GET /trade-api/v2/portfolio/summary/total_resting_order_value` now returns
  `resting_order_value_breakdown`, with a fixed-point dollar `balance` for each
  exchange index.
</Update>

<Update label="August 20, 2026">
  `GET /portfolio/orders`, `GET /portfolio/positions`, and `GET /portfolio/fills` now accept an optional `exchange_index` filter.
  Omitting it returns results from all exchange indexes.
</Update>

<Update label="August 20, 2026">
  Sub-account-restricted API keys can now use the
  [communications endpoints](/api-reference/communications) and create combo
  markets, scoped to the key's locked sub-account: omitting `subaccount` acts
  on the locked sub-account, any other sub-account is rejected, and a
  different sub-account's RFQs and quotes cannot be read in detail or acted
  on. Scoping matches rows created through the API; web-created RFQs are not
  addressable per sub-account. The `write::trade` scope is now sufficient for
  `POST /multivariate_event_collections/{collection_ticker}` (parent `write`
  keys are unaffected). On FIX, restricted sessions still support the maker
  quote lifecycle only; block-trade endpoints also remain unavailable to
  restricted keys.
</Update>

<Update label="August 16, 2026">
  `GET /trade-api/v2/api_keys` now returns `api_key_region_expiration_ts`, the
  unix timestamp (seconds) when your location attestation for API key requests
  expires. Once this date has passed, API keys are not valid for trading
  Sports, Elections, and Entertainment markets. The field is absent when the
  account has never attested.
</Update>

<Update label="August 13, 2026">
  A new `price_level_structure`, `center_deci_edge_centi_cent`, is available:
  \$0.0001 (0.01¢) ticks below \$0.01 and above \$0.99, with \$0.001 (0.1¢)
  ticks in between. No API fields or message formats change. As with other
  structures, snap order and RFQ quote prices to the `step` of the band
  containing the price in the market's `price_ranges` array rather than
  keying off the structure name. See
  [Fixed-Point Representation](/getting_started/fixed_point_migration) for the
  full structure reference.
</Update>

<Update label="August 13, 2026">
  `GET /trade-api/v2/portfolio/balance` now scopes `portfolio_value` to the
  requested `exchange_index` (defaulting to 0); it previously covered
  positions across all exchange indexes. Passing `subaccount` explicitly
  (including 0, previously treated as omitted) returns that subaccount's
  `balance` on the requested exchange index. Omitting `subaccount` keeps
  the primary account's aggregate `balance`.
</Update>

<Update label="August 13, 2026">
  Predictions trade WebSocket messages now include `is_block_trade`, indicating
  whether the trade was matched off book.
</Update>

<Update label="August 13, 2026">
  Each `exchange_index_statuses` entry now includes its shard `description`.
</Update>

<Update label="August 13, 2026">
  Margin order groups are now bound to a single `exchange_index`.
  Order groups may only reference markets belonging to their respective `exchange_index`.

  Affected endpoints:

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/margin/markets`
  * `GET /trade-api/v2/margin/markets/{ticker}`
  * `POST /trade-api/v2/margin/order_groups/create`

  For now, all margin markets are `exchange_index=0`.
</Update>

<Update label="August 13, 2026">
  The maximum number of order groups a user can have at a time is increasing
  from 25,000 to 100,000.

  **Affected endpoint:** `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/order_groups/create`
</Update>

<Update label="August 6, 2026">
  The deprecated multivariate lookup surface has been removed:

  * `PUT /trade-api/v2/multivariate_event_collections/{collection_ticker}/lookup` no longer exists. This endpoint predated RFQs and had been marked deprecated; use `POST /trade-api/v2/multivariate_event_collections/{collection_ticker}` to create or resolve a combo market, or the communications (RFQ) APIs for quoting workflows.
  * The `multivariate` WebSocket channel (message type `multivariate_lookup`) no longer exists. Subscriptions to it now return an unknown-channel error. For multivariate market state changes, use the `multivariate_market_lifecycle` channel.
</Update>

<Update label="August 17, 2026">
  Multivariate (combo) markets are moving from `deci_cent` (\$0.001 ticks) to
  a new `price_level_structure`, `center_centi_edge_centi_cent`: a uniform
  \$0.0001 (0.01¢) tick across the full range. Other markets are unchanged.

  No API fields or message formats change. Prices on these markets use all
  four decimal places of the existing `*_dollars` fields — read prices from
  those fields (integer-cent fields cannot represent sub-cent prices) and
  snap order and RFQ quote prices to the `step` in the market's
  `price_ranges` array rather than keying off the structure name.

  Existing combo markets migrate in place with resting orders preserved, each
  emitting the existing `price_level_structure_updated` event with its new
  `price_ranges`. See [Fixed-Point Representation](/getting_started/fixed_point_migration)
  for the full structure reference.
</Update>

<Update label="August 13, 2026">
  When an RFQ (`35=R`) selects legs that form an invalid multivariate
  combination, the `QuoteRequestReject` (`35=AG`) now carries three new
  pieces of information:

  * `MVEValidationReasonCode` (20187): a stable reason code —
    `conflicting_leg_outcomes`, `duplicated_legs`, or
    `invalid_market_combination` — matching the `code` field of the REST
    error body. Branch on this.
  * `Text` (58): a human-readable explanation of why the combination is
    invalid.
  * `NoMVEOffendingLegs` (20185): a repeating group of the offending market
    tickers, each entry carrying `MVEOffendingMarketTicker` (20186).

  `QuoteRequestRejectReason` (658) is unchanged (`99` = OTHER), so existing
  handling keeps working. This mirrors the richer REST error bodies on
  `POST /trade-api/v2/multivariate_event_collections/{collection_ticker}`.
</Update>

<Update label="August 13, 2026">
  Adding APIs to track intra-exchange account transfers:

  * `GET /portfolio/intra_exchange_instance_transfers` (paginated history)
  * `GET /portfolio/intra_exchange_instance_transfers/{transfer_id}`
</Update>

<Update label="August 6, 2026">
  Exchange-generated order and trade `ExecutionReport (35=8)` messages now include `LastMkt<30>` with the source exchange index.
</Update>

<Update label="August 6, 2026">
  `GET /trade-api/v2/margin/markets` and `GET /trade-api/v2/margin/markets/{ticker}`
  now return `long_leverage_estimates` and `short_leverage_estimates`, keyed by the
  same notional sizes as `leverage_estimates`.
</Update>

<Update label="August 6, 2026">
  `PUT /portfolio/order_groups/{order_group_id}/limit` now supports the `subaccount` parameter.
</Update>

<Update label="August 6, 2026">
  Multivariate event collection responses now include `exchange_index`.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /multivariate_event_collections`
  * `GET /multivariate_event_collections/{collection_ticker}`
</Update>

<Update label="July 30, 2026">
  `POST /trade-api/v2/multivariate_event_collections/{collection_ticker}` now
  returns richer error bodies when the selected legs form an invalid
  combination. The `message` field explains why the combination is invalid
  (for example, which selections conflict), and the `details` field lists the
  offending market tickers as a comma-separated string when they are known.

  The `code` field is unchanged (`conflicting_leg_outcomes`,
  `duplicated_legs`, `invalid_market_combination`), so existing error
  handling keeps working.
</Update>

<Update label="August 6, 2026">
  The `service` field announced as deprecated on July 28 has been removed from
  error response bodies. It is no longer returned by any REST endpoint.

  Branch on `code` instead, which is present on every error response. Clients
  that read `service` should treat it as absent; clients that already branch on
  `code` need no change.
</Update>

<Update label="July 28, 2026">
  The `service` field on error response bodies is deprecated and will be removed
  in a future release. It names the internal Kalshi service that produced the
  error, is absent from many error responses already, and is not a stable way to
  classify failures.

  Use the `code` field instead, which is present on every error response and is
  the intended contract for branching. No response has changed yet — `service`
  is still returned wherever it was before.
</Update>

<Update label="July 30, 2026">
  Market created messages on the `market_lifecycle_v2` and
  `multivariate_market_lifecycle` channels now include an `exchange_index`
  field identifying the exchange shard the market lives on. `event_lifecycle`
  messages include the same field for the event's markets.

  **Affected channels:**

  * `market_lifecycle_v2`
  * `multivariate_market_lifecycle`
</Update>

<Update label="July 30, 2026">
  `GET /series` now exposes `exchange_index`, identifying the target exchange instance for new events.
</Update>

<Update label="July 30, 2026">
  A new endpoint, `GET /trade-api/v2/live_data/events/{event_ticker}`, returns
  live data keyed by event ticker — previously only available on the internal
  API. It serves event-keyed live data such as crypto price charts (e.g.
  `KXBTC15M` events), commodity price timeseries, and weather observations.

  The response's `live_data.type` field names the schema of the flexible
  `live_data.details` object. An optional `range` query parameter (e.g.
  `15min`, `1h`, `1d`) restricts the returned timeseries window where the
  underlying live data type supports it.
</Update>

<Update label="July 30, 2026">
  API keys restricted to a single subaccount, previously rejected with a 403
  on the order queue position endpoints, can now read queue positions for
  orders in their locked subaccount. The queue positions listing infers the
  key's locked subaccount when the `subaccount` parameter is omitted and
  rejects requests that explicitly target a different subaccount. The
  single-order endpoint returns a 404 for orders outside the locked
  subaccount.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders/queue_positions`
  * `GET /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders/{order_id}/queue_position`
</Update>

<Update label="July 30, 2026">
  Event objects returned by the REST API now include a `cadence` value inside
  `product_metadata` when the event has one set. It tells you how often the
  event recurs, for example `fifteen_min`. Events without a cadence set are
  returned the same as before.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/events`
  * `GET /trade-api/v2/events/{event_ticker}`
</Update>

<Update label="July 30, 2026">
  API keys restricted to a single subaccount, previously rejected with a 403
  on the batch order endpoints, can now batch-create and batch-cancel orders.
  The API infers the key's locked subaccount for any order in the batch that
  omits it, and rejects the whole batch (no orders are placed or canceled) if
  any entry explicitly targets a different subaccount.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/batched`
  * `DELETE /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/batched`
</Update>

<Update label="July 30, 2026">
  The `quote_created` message on the `communications` channel now includes a
  `subaccount` field when your side of the quote used a subaccount, matching
  `quote_accepted` and `quote_executed`. Quote creators receive the subaccount
  their quote was placed under; RFQ creators receive the subaccount their RFQ
  was created under. Each recipient sees only their own subaccount number,
  never the counterparty's.

  This lets makers quoting from multiple subaccounts attribute a
  `quote_created` message immediately, without waiting for the
  `POST /trade-api/v2/communications/quotes` response.
</Update>

<Update label="July 30, 2026">
  API keys restricted to a single subaccount can now use every REST order-group
  endpoint. The API infers the key's locked subaccount when the request omits
  it and rejects requests that explicitly target a different subaccount.

  Unrestricted API keys are unaffected.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * All `/trade-api/v2/portfolio/order_groups` endpoints
  * All `/trade-api/v2/margin/order_groups` endpoints
</Update>

<Update label="July 23, 2026">
  Attempts to create an order group after reaching the 25,000-group limit will
  be rejected.

  Before the change window, users above the limit will have their oldest unused
  order groups cancelled until 20,000 remain, leaving headroom below the new
  limit. Order groups containing resting orders will not be selected for this
  cleanup.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/order_groups/create`
  * `POST /trade-api/v2/margin/order_groups/create`
</Update>

<Update label="July 22, 2026">
  `GET /incentive_programs` now excludes incentive programs whose market
  belongs to a hidden event, matching the visibility of the events themselves.
</Update>

<Update label="July 23, 2026">
  Added `GET /historical/positions` — an authenticated endpoint for querying settled positions archived to the historical database. Supports `ticker` and `event_ticker` filtering with cursor pagination.

  Positions are archived per whole event: a settled event's positions move to the historical database together and are never split between this endpoint and `GET /portfolio/positions`. Use this endpoint for positions older than the new `market_positions_last_updated_ts` cutoff returned by `GET /historical/cutoff`. See [Historical Data](/getting_started/historical_data) for details.
</Update>

<Update label="July 23, 2026">
  Subaccount-restricted API keys, previously denied at session start, can now
  open WebSocket sessions. Private channels are scoped to the key's locked
  subaccount — `fill`, `user_orders`, `market_positions`,
  `order_group_updates`, `communications`, and `orderbook_delta`
  (`fill`, `user_orders`, `order_group_updates`, and `orderbook_delta` on the
  Margin exchange) — so a restricted key sees exactly what a full-account key
  sees, minus every sibling subaccount.

  * `orderbook_delta` still delivers the full book; only the own-order
    annotation (`subaccount`, `client_order_id`) is withheld when a resting
    order belongs to a sibling subaccount.
  * `communications` still broadcasts every RFQ (public by design, so makers
    can quote them); only quotes, acceptances, and executions are scoped.

  Full-account keys are unaffected. No new fields are introduced.
</Update>

<Update label="July 23, 2026">
  An API key restricted to a single subaccount (created via `POST /api_keys`
  with `subaccount`), previously rejected at logon, can now log on to an
  `RfqMode` FIX session and run the maker quote lifecycle: `Quote (35=S)`,
  `QuoteConfirm (35=U7)`, and `QuoteCancel (35=Z)`.

  Every quote is pinned to the key's subaccount: on `Quote (35=S)`, an omitted
  `AllocAccount<79>` defaults to it and a mismatching value is rejected;
  `QuoteConfirm` and `QuoteCancel` act only on that subaccount's quotes; fills
  attribute to it. You can run one restricted key per subaccount with
  concurrent RFQ sessions — a quote acceptance routes to the session that
  created the quote.

  Creating an RFQ (`35=R`) and `AcceptQuote (35=UA)` remain unavailable to
  restricted keys. Unrestricted keys are unchanged.

<Update label="July 9, 2026">
  REST now supports looking up a quote within a specific RFQ by passing both the
  RFQ ID and quote ID in the path. The quote must belong to the requested RFQ;
  otherwise, the endpoint returns `404 Not Found`.

  The quote-ID-only lookup endpoint remains supported for now, but is
  deprecated. Use the RFQ-scoped lookup endpoint instead.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/communications/rfqs/{rfq_id}/quotes/{quote_id}`
  * `GET /trade-api/v2/communications/quotes/{quote_id}`
</Update>

<Update label="July 4, 2026">
  `GET /trade-api/v2/exchange/announcements` has been removed from the Predictions
  REST API. Exchange schedule remains available through
  `GET /trade-api/v2/exchange/schedule`.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/exchange/announcements`
</Update>

<Update label="July 9, 2026">
  The following deprecated fields have been removed from the Predictions REST API schema:

  * `Market.response_price_units`
  * `Market.fractional_trading_enabled`
  * `MarketPosition.resting_orders_count`

  `Market.price_level_structure`, `Market.price_ranges`, and the fixed-point count and dollar
  fields remain the canonical replacements.
</Update>

<Update label="July 9, 2026">
  `GET /trade-api/v2/margin/orders` now includes an `order_reason` field when
  `order_source` is `system`. The field is `liquidation` for liquidation orders
  and `take_profit_stop_loss` for take-profit/stop-loss orders. User-placed
  orders continue to omit `order_reason`.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/margin/orders`
</Update>

<Update label="July 23, 2026">
  Seven new `price_level_structure` values are being introduced:
  `center_whole_edge_half_cent`, `center_whole_edge_quint_cent`,
  `center_half_edge_half_cent`, `center_half_edge_quint_cent`,
  `center_half_edge_deci_cent`, `center_quint_edge_quint_cent`, and
  `center_quint_edge_deci_cent`. Naming follows
  `center_{center}_edge_{edge}_cent`, where `whole` = 1¢, `half` = 0.5¢,
  `quint` = 0.2¢, and `deci` = 0.1¢. Edge bands are \$0.00–\$0.10 and
  \$0.90–\$1.00; the center band is \$0.10–\$0.90. Existing values
  (`linear_cent`, `tapered_deci_cent`, `deci_cent`) are unchanged.

  There are no new fields and no new decimal precision. The source of truth
  for a market's valid prices remains the `price_ranges` array on the market
  object (`{ start, end, step }` bands in fixed-point dollars) — consume it
  dynamically per market rather than keying logic off the
  `price_level_structure` label. Structure changes are delivered on the
  existing `market_lifecycle_v2` WebSocket channel via the existing
  `price_level_structure_updated` event, which includes the updated
  `price_ranges`. When a market moves to a finer tick, resting orders are
  preserved and carried over to the new grid.

  Rollout: pilot markets switch to the new structures the week of
  July 27, 2026, scheduled to avoid disrupting actively-trading markets,
  with expansion to higher-volume markets the week of August 3, 2026.

  Each position returned by `GET /trade-api/v2/margin/risk` and
  `GET /trade-api/v2/margin/positions` now includes an `is_portfolio` flag. When it
  is `true`, the position is hedged within a portfolio, so its per-position risk
  metrics cannot be attributed to it individually and are not reported — on
  `/margin/risk` that means `maintenance_margin_required`, `position_leverage`, and
  `estimated_liquidation_price`, and on `/margin/positions` that means `margin_used`
  and the derived `roe`. When it is `false`, those per-position values are populated
  as before.

<Update label="July 2, 2026">
  The `market_lifecycle_v2` channel now emits an optional `price_ranges` array
  alongside `price_level_structure` on `created` and
  `price_level_structure_updated` events. Each entry is a `{ start, end, step }`
  band in fixed-point dollars describing the market's valid prices — the same
  data returned on the REST market object.

  This lets consumers read a market's valid-price grid directly from the event,
  with no follow-up REST call when a market's tick size / structure changes. The
  field is only present on events that carry a `price_level_structure`.

  **Affected channel:**

  * `market_lifecycle_v2` (`created`, `price_level_structure_updated` events)
</Update>

<Update label="June 29, 2026">
  `GET /trade-api/v2/margin/positions` now omits `margin_used` (and the derived
  `roe`) for a portfolio-margin position that shares its asset class with other
  positions in the same subaccount. Margin for those positions is computed jointly
  for the group and is not attributable to a single market. `margin_used` stays
  populated for gross markets and for single-position (lone) portfolio markets.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/margin/positions`
</Update>

<Update label="June 26, 2026">
  Effective immediately, `GET /trade-api/v2/margin/risk` no longer populates per-market maintenance

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/margin/risk`
</Update>

<Update label="July 2, 2026">
  `GET /trade-api/v2/exchange/status` now returns two additional fields:

  * `intra_exchange_transfers_active` — whether intra-exchange transfers are
    currently permitted.
  * `exchange_index_statuses` — a per-index breakdown with one entry per exchange
    index. Each entry carries `exchange_index`, `exchange_active`,
    `trading_active`, and `intra_exchange_transfers_active`.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/exchange/status`
</Update>

<Update label="July 2, 2026">
  `GET /trade-api/v2/portfolio/subaccounts/balances` now returns one balance per
  exchange index. Each entry includes an `exchange_index` field, so a subaccount
  with funds on multiple indexes appears as multiple entries rather than a single
  combined row.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/portfolio/subaccounts/balances`
</Update>

<Update label="July 2, 2026">
  On `AcceptQuote (35=UA)`, when a quote can no longer be accepted the
  `AcceptQuoteStatus (35=UC)` reject (`AcceptQuoteStatus<21025>=1`) now reports a
  specific reason in `Text<58>` rather than a generic message — notably
  `NOT_FOUND` when the quote was cleared by a server roll/restart (or is
  otherwise unknown) and `EXPIRED` when it was cancelled or has expired — so RFQ
  creators can distinguish a flushed quote from a genuine cancellation.

  **Affected FIX messages:**

  * `AcceptQuote (35=UA)`
</Update>

<Update label="July 2, 2026">
  Previously, some `OrderCancelReplaceRequest (35=G)` and
  `OrderCancelRequest (35=F)` failures came back as an `OrderCancelReject (35=9)`
  with `Text<58>=INTERNAL_ERROR`, even though the exchange had cleanly rejected
  the request for a specific reason. The most common case was replacing an order
  with a price the market does not accept, for example a sub-tick price on a
  market that does not support fractional prices.

  These rejects now report the underlying reason in `Text<58>`, with a
  corresponding `CxlRejReason<102>`:

  * Invalid price (off-tick, out-of-band, `$0`, or `$1`): `Text<58>=INVALID_PRICE`, `CxlRejReason<102>=99` (Other)
  * Unknown market: `Text<58>=MARKET_NOT_FOUND`, `CxlRejReason<102>=99` (Other)
  * Duplicate client order ID: `Text<58>=ORDER_ALREADY_EXISTS`, `CxlRejReason<102>=6` (Duplicate ClOrdID)

  A rejected cancel or replace does not change the original order; it continues
  to rest unchanged. Clients that branched on `Text<58>=INTERNAL_ERROR` for these
  cases should switch to reading the specific reason text.
</Update>

<Update label="June 25, 2026">
  Effective immediately, RFQ quotes are no longer guaranteed to remain queryable
  unless they have reached a post-acceptance state: `accepted`, `confirmed`, or
  `executed`. Open quotes and cancelled quotes may still be returned on a
  best-effort basis, but clients should not treat them as durable records. If an
  open quote is cleared during a server roll or restart, it should be treated as
  effectively cancelled and no longer actionable, even if there is no queryable
  cancelled quote record. Later requests for that quote may return
  `404 Not Found`.

  Clients should store the RFQ ID returned for each RFQ and include it alongside
  the quote ID when performing quote actions. REST now supports RFQ-scoped quote
  action endpoints using `rfq_id` as a path parameter:

  * `DELETE /trade-api/v2/communications/rfqs/{rfq_id}/quotes/{quote_id}`
  * `PUT /trade-api/v2/communications/rfqs/{rfq_id}/quotes/{quote_id}/accept`
  * `PUT /trade-api/v2/communications/rfqs/{rfq_id}/quotes/{quote_id}/confirm`

  The existing quote-ID-only action endpoints remain supported for now, but are
  deprecated. Use the RFQ-scoped action endpoints instead:

  * `DELETE /trade-api/v2/communications/quotes/{quote_id}`
  * `PUT /trade-api/v2/communications/quotes/{quote_id}/accept`
  * `PUT /trade-api/v2/communications/quotes/{quote_id}/confirm`

  For FIX, quote actions now accept optional `RfqId<21023>` together with
  `QuoteId<117>` on `QuoteCancel (35=Z)`, `QuoteConfirm (35=U7)`, and
  `AcceptQuote (35=UA)`. When `RfqId<21023>` is provided, the quote must belong
  to that RFQ; when it is omitted, the exchange will continue to resolve the RFQ
  from `QuoteId<117>` on a best-effort basis.

  We expect `rfq_id` / `RfqId<21023>` to become required for quote actions in a
  future migration, but this requirement will not take effect within the next
  7 days. Start sending the RFQ ID now to avoid future migration work.

  restricted key may only read and trade on that one sub-account: requests that
  target another sub-account are rejected, and the key cannot transfer funds
  between sub-accounts or create sub-accounts. Restricted keys can use supported
  REST and FIX order-entry or market-data sessions; they cannot open WebSocket,
  FIX listener, drop-copy, RFQ, or retransmission sessions. `GET /api_keys`

  strike range directly from the push — e.g. a `between` band needs both floor
  and cap, and `less` markets are cap-only — without a follow-up fetch against
  the eventually-consistent read model.

  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders` - cost `15` to `50`
  * `DELETE /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders/{order_id}` - cost `3` to `10`
  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders/{order_id}/amend` - cost `15` to `50`
  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders/{order_id}/decrease` - cost `15` to `50`
  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders/batched` - cost `15` to `50`
  * `DELETE /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders/batched` - cost `3` to `10`
</Update>

<Update label="May 29, 2026">
  Public V2 trade responses now include `is_block_trade`, which identifies
  trades matched off-book as block trades. The same endpoints now support an
  optional `is_block_trade` query parameter; omit it to return all trades, set
  it to `true` for only block trades, or set it to `false` for only non-block
  trades.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/markets/trades`
  * `GET /trade-api/v2/historical/trades`
</Update>

<Update label="May 29, 2026">
  **FIX API v1.0.29**

  * Added market lifecycle support on the `KalshiMD` session via Security Status messages
    * `SecurityStatusRequest` (35=e) subscribes (`263=1`) or unsubscribes (`263=2`) a single `Symbol<55>`
    * `SecurityStatus` (35=f) streams `SecurityTradingStatus<326>` changes: `3`=resume (activated), `2`=trading halt, `100`=Kalshi determined, `101`=Kalshi settled
    * Changes-only: no initial snapshot is sent on subscribe
    * For more info see [Market Data](/fix/market-data)
</Update>

<Update label="May 28, 2026">
  Starting Thursday, May 28, 2026, `GET /portfolio/balance` returns `balance_dollars`, the member's available balance as a fixed-point dollar string, alongside the existing integer-cent `balance` field. This precision change applies only to direct members of the exchange: direct member balances are aligned to centi-cent (`$0.0001`, or `0.01c`) precision. The legacy `balance` field truncates any sub-cent amount, so use `balance_dollars` for exact values.

  See [Fee Rounding](/getting_started/fee_rounding) for balance alignment and rounding mechanics.
</Update>

<Update label="May 28, 2026">
  **FIX API v1.0.28**

  * Added market data support on the dedicated `KalshiMD` session
    * Subscriptions are identified by `Symbol<55>`
    * `MarketDataRequest` (35=V) requests order book snapshots (`263=0`) or snapshot-plus-updates subscriptions (`263=1`); cancel with `263=2` (symbols in `55`, or none to cancel all)
    * `MarketDataSnapshotFullRefresh` (35=W) returns the full aggregated book; `MarketDataIncrementalRefresh` (35=X) streams subsequent level changes
    * `MarketDataRequestReject` (35=Y) is sent when a request cannot be accepted
    * For more info see [Market Data](/fix/market-data)
</Update>

<Update label="May 28, 2026">
  **FIX API v1.0.27**

  * Starting Thursday, May 28, 2026, direct member BALANCE collateral changes on ExecutionReport (35=8) may be emitted with four decimal places
</Update>

<Update label="May 25, 2026">
  Effective Monday, May 25, 2026, rate-limit token costs for legacy
  `/portfolio/orders` mutation and batch endpoints are increased. The V2
  `/portfolio/events/orders` endpoints are unchanged.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders` - cost `10` to `15`
  * `DELETE /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders/{order_id}` - cost `2` to `3`
  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders/{order_id}/amend` - cost `10` to `15`
  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders/{order_id}/decrease` - cost `10` to `15`
  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders/batched` - cost `10` to `15`
  * `DELETE /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders/batched` - cost `2` to `3`
</Update>

<Update label="May 21, 2026">
  In certain uncommon cases, responses from `DELETE /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}` and `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}/amend` do not describe the order that was cancelled or amended — the `order_id`, `client_order_id`, and quantity fields (`reduced_by_centicount`, `remaining_centicount`, fill fields) in the response may not correspond to your request. The cancel or amend itself executes correctly against the intended order; only the response body is affected. Downstream order and position state are correct.

  As a result, the previously announced rate-limit cost bump on the legacy `/portfolio/orders*` endpoints is delayed until May 21.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `DELETE /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}`
  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}/amend`
</Update>

<Update label="May 18, 2026">
  **FIX API v1.0.26**

  * Added `SplitCollateralReturn` (21027) Logon flag
    * With Logon flag `21027=Y`, Execution Reports with `ExecType=Trade` include two new tags:
      * `SingleMarketCollateralReturn` (21030): collateral freed from reducing/closing a position in a single market
      * `RangedMarketCollateralReturn` (21031): collateral freed from MECNET/DIRECNET netting across a market group
    * Both values are in dollars and only present when non-zero
    * These are informational subsets of the existing BALANCE collateral change — they describe components within the total balance delta
    * Without `21027`, Execution Reports remain unchanged (existing behavior)
</Update>

<Update label="May 12, 2026">
  `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}/decrease` now
  accepts `reduce_by` (fixed-point contract count) in addition to
  `reduce_to`. Exactly one of the two must be provided.
</Update>

<Update label="May 12, 2026">
  Subaccount creation now supported for all direct members with advanced API access.
</Update>

<Update label="May 12, 2026">
  The WebSocket docs now include the current public error code list with each
  code's name, message, description, and user-error classification.

  WebSocket error code `25` is now returned as `Subscription buffer overflow`
  when a subscription's event buffer overflows during a message burst. When this
  happens, subscribe to a smaller subset of data, or ensure that your connection
  read throughput is optimized.

  See the [WebSocket error messages](/websockets/websocket-connection#error-messages)
  section for the full list.
</Update>

<Update label="May 11, 2026">
  Cancelled quotes are now automatically deleted 14 days after cancellation. Previously, only quotes associated with closed RFQs were cleaned up. This applies to all cancelled quotes regardless of their parent RFQ status.

  Affected endpoint: `GET /communications/quotes`.
</Update>

<Update label="May 11, 2026">
  `GET /trade-api/v2/margin/fee_tiers` now returns `maker_fee_rates` and
  `taker_fee_rates`. Each is a map from market ticker to the fee rate as
  a decimal fraction of notional (e.g. `0.0008` = 0.08% = 8 bps). Compute
  the expected fee directly as `notional * rate`.

  The previous `maker_fee_tiers` and `taker_fee_tiers` tier-name maps have
  been removed from the response.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/margin/fee_tiers`
</Update>

<Update label="May 11, 2026">
  The `metadata_updated` event on the `market_lifecycle_v2` WebSocket channel
  now includes `yes_sub_title` as a top-level field when a market's yes
  subtitle changes.

  **Affected channels:**

  * `market_lifecycle_v2`
</Update>

<Update label="May 8, 2026">
  **FIX API v1.0.25**

  * BidSize (134) and OfferSize (135) conditionally offered on QuoteStatusReport (35=AI).

<Update label="May 7, 2026">
  `CreateOrderGroup` now returns `subaccount`, the subaccount number that owns the created order group. The value is `0` for the primary account and `1-63` for subaccounts.

  Affected endpoint: `POST /portfolio/order_groups/create`.
</Update>

<Update label="May 7, 2026">
  Added `rfq_user_filter` to `GetQuotes` for filtering by quotes in response to RFQs created by the authenticated user.

  Affected endpoint: `GET /communications/quotes`.

<Update label="May 7, 2026">
  **FIX API v1.0.24**

  * OrderGroupResponse (UOH) now echoes AllocAccount (tag 79), with `79=0` for the primary account and `79=1-63` for subaccounts
</Update>

<Update label="May 6, 2026">
  Order, Fill, and Trade responses now include two new normalized direction
  fields. Each carries the full directional bit on its own — combining
  `action` with `side` is no longer required to know what the user is
  positioned for. The two fields encode the same bit in two vocabularies:
  `bid` is equivalent to `yes`, `ask` is equivalent to `no`.

  * `outcome_side` (`yes` | `no`) — the outcome the user profits from.
    Buy-yes and sell-no produce `yes`; buy-no and sell-yes produce `no`.
  * `book_side` (`bid` | `ask`) — same bit in book vocabulary.

  Affected REST responses (`svc-api2`):

  * `Order` (GetOrders, GetOrder, GetHistoricalOrders, and order-write responses)
  * `Fill` (GetFills, GetFillsHistorical)
  * `Trade` (public) — fields are named `taker_outcome_side` and `taker_book_side` to match the existing `taker_side`

  Affected WebSocket channels (`svc-apiexternal-ws`):

  * `user_orders`
  * `fill`
  * `trade` — `taker_outcome_side` and `taker_book_side`

  `outcome_side` describes directional exposure only; it does not change
  the order's price. An order at price `p` with `outcome_side=no` is
  matched by an order at the same price `p` with `outcome_side=yes` —
  both parties trade at the same price, just on opposite directions.

  Existing `action`, `side`, `is_yes`, `purchased_side`, and `taker_side`
  fields are now marked deprecated. `outcome_side` and `book_side` are
  the canonical way to determine order/trade direction going forward.
  The legacy fields **will not be removed before May 28, 2026** — please
  migrate to the new fields when integrating against these endpoints.

  See the [Order direction](/getting_started/order_direction) reference
  page for the full migration table and equivalence rules.
</Update>

<Update label="May 7, 2026">
  Added the dedicated external Trade API hosts to the docs and examples:

  * Production REST: `https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2`
  * Production WebSocket: `wss://external-api-ws.kalshi.com/trade-api/ws/v2`
  * Demo REST: `https://external-api.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/v2`
  * Demo WebSocket: `wss://external-api-ws.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2`

  Existing shared hosts remain supported for compatibility. Request signing is unchanged: sign the full request path from the API root, without the hostname or query string.
</Update>

<Update label="May 5, 2026">
  The `market_lifecycle_v2` WebSocket channel now supports a new event type
  `metadata_updated`. Initially this will only be triggered by a floor strike
  update, but may expand to more fields in the future. The message contains the
  updated `floor_strike` as a top-level field.

  **Affected channels:**

  * `market_lifecycle_v2`
</Update>

<Update label="May 5, 2026">
  Added `post_only` as an option when creating a quote.
  If the quote is marked post-only, it will never take resting orders on the book or be subject to a taker fee: it will be automatically cancelled at the normal execution if it were to match with a resting order.
</Update>

<Update label="May 5, 2026">
  Added `GET /trade-api/v2/portfolio/deposits` and `GET /trade-api/v2/portfolio/withdrawals` endpoints.

  * Query deposit/withdrawal history for the authenticated user
  * Cursor-based pagination via `limit` and `cursor` parameters

  **New endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/portfolio/deposits`
  * `GET /trade-api/v2/portfolio/withdrawals`
</Update>

<Update label="May 5, 2026">
  V2 order mutating endpoints now include a `ts_ms` field carrying the
  matching engine's wall-clock timestamp at which the request was
  processed, as Unix epoch milliseconds:

  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders`
  * `DELETE /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}`
  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}/decrease`

  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/batched`
  * `DELETE /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/batched`

  The `order_group_updates` WebSocket channel payload now includes a
  `ts_ms` field with the same matching-engine timestamp, matching the
  pattern already used by `trades`, `fill`, `user_orders`, and
  `orderbook_delta`.
</Update>

<Update label="May 5, 2026">
  **FIX API v1.0.23**

  * Quote (35=S) now accepts `RestRemainder` (21015)
    * Set `21015=Y` to rest the quote remainder after execution
    * Omitting the tag or setting `21015=N` preserves the existing behavior
</Update>

<Update label="May 1, 2026">
  Added `user_filter=self` to filter RFQs and quotes by the authenticated user.
  Existing creator user ID filters remain supported temporarily but are considered deprecated.

<Update label="Apr 30, 2026">
  The deprecated `tick_size` field on Market response objects has been
  deprecated since **Jan 5, 2026** and will be removed on **May 7, 2026**.

  Use `price_level_structure` and `price_ranges[].step` to determine each
  market's valid tick sizes.

  **Affected responses:**

  * Market response objects returned by REST API v2 endpoints
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 30, 2026">
  Beginning Apr 30, 2026, `GET /trade-api/v2/account/limits` returns a
  nested object per bucket with `refill_rate` (tokens added per second)
  and `bucket_capacity` (max tokens the bucket can hold). When the bucket
  has no burst headroom, `bucket_capacity` equals `refill_rate` — i.e.
  one second of budget.

  ```json theme={null}
  {
    "usage_tier": "advanced",

  **FIX API v1.0.22**

  * Added `AlwaysEmitNewBeforeTrade` (21026) Logon flag
    * With Logon flag `21026=Y`, the gateway always emits a standalone `New<0>` execution report before any `Trade<F>` report, even when an order takes liquidity in the same matching cycle as its placement
    * Without `21026`, the New ack continues to be folded into the first Trade report when both events arrive in the same batch (existing behavior)
    * Useful for clients whose state machines require an explicit `39=0` ack before they can issue replaces against the order
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 22, 2026">
  Added a public endpoint to inspect the routes whose configured token
  cost differs from the default 10-token cost.

  The response includes `default_cost` for context and lists only the
  endpoints that do not use that default cost.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/account/endpoint_costs`
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 23, 2026">
  Write endpoints now allow brief bursts above your per-second budget — when
  your client is running below its steady rate, the unused capacity
  accumulates and can be spent in a single pulse. See
  [Rate Limits and Tiers](/getting_started/rate_limits) for details.
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 22, 2026">
  **New endpoints:**

  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders` — create
  * `DELETE /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}` — cancel
  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}/amend` — amend
  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}/decrease` — decrease
  * `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/batched` — batch create
  * `DELETE /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/batched` — batch cancel

  **We recommend all clients switch over.** The existing `/portfolio/orders*` endpoints will be marked deprecated no earlier than **May 21, 2026**. Rate-limit costs on the legacy `/portfolio/orders*` endpoints may also increase starting **May 14, 2026** — migrate to the V2 endpoints to avoid disruption.
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 23, 2026">
  Rolling out a new token-cost rate-limit system with separate read and write
  budgets and a new **Paragon** tier. All existing tiers get at least as much

  In the coming weeks, single-query read endpoints will be priced below
  the default cost.
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 20, 2026">
  Added `get_snapshot` action to `update_subscription` on the `orderbook_delta` WebSocket channel.

  Sends an `orderbook_snapshot` response for the requested markets without adding them to the subscription or affecting the existing delta stream.

  ```json theme={null}
  {

  **FIX API v1.0.21**

  * OrderGroupRequest (UOG) now accepts AllocAccount (tag 79) to scope the operation to a subaccount
    * Applies to all five actions: Create, Reset, Delete, Trigger, Update
    * Omit or set `79=0` to operate on the primary account
    * An OrderGroupID created under one subaccount cannot be managed without the matching AllocAccount on the follow-up request
  * OrderGroupResponse (UOH) now echoes OrderGroupContractsLimit (tag 20132) on Create and Update responses
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 17, 2026">
  The `fractional_trading_enabled` field on `Market` and `EventChildMarket` responses is deprecated. It no longer carries information:

  * `Market` and `EventChildMarket` responses now support fractional trading unconditionally — the field is always `true`.

  The `fractional_trading_updated` event on the `market_lifecycle_v2` WebSocket channel is removed, since the underlying state can no longer change.

  The `fractional_trading_enabled` field will be removed in a future release after a separate pre-announcement that includes the exact removal date. Clients relying on this field should stop reading it; treat every active market returned by these responses as fractional.
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 16, 2026">
  Added `occurrence_datetime` to API v2 market responses.

  This field returns the recorded datetime when the underlying event occurred, when that value is available.

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/events`
  * `GET /trade-api/v2/events/:event_ticker`

<Update label="Apr 15, 2026">
  Added new millisecond Unix timestamp fields to non-margin WebSocket messages while keeping the existing seconds and RFC3339 timestamp fields unchanged for now.

  ```diff theme={null}

  + orderbook_delta.ts_ms
  + user_order.created_ts_ms
  + user_order.last_updated_ts_ms

<Update label="Mar 25, 2026">
  **Effective April 2, 2026**

  This release removes the last remaining legacy fields:

  * Removed `yes_total_cost` and `no_total_cost` (integer cents) from `GET /portfolio/settlements`. Use `yes_total_cost_dollars` and `no_total_cost_dollars`.
  * Removed `yes_price_fixed` and `no_price_fixed` (string aliases) from `GET /portfolio/fills`. Use `yes_price_dollars` and `no_price_dollars`.
  * Removed `position_cost`, `realized_pnl`, `fees_paid`, and `position_fee_cost` (integer centi-cents) from the `market_positions` WebSocket channel. Use the `_dollars` equivalents.

  Fixed `GET /markets` and `GET /markets/{ticker}` so `custom_strike["Multivariate Event Ticker"]` returns the actual multivariate event ticker instead of the MVE collection ticker.
</Update>

<Update label="Mar 19, 2026">
  Added a new `multivariate_market_lifecycle` WebSocket channel for multivariate event (MVE) markets.

  This channel emits MVE lifecycle messages for:

  * `created`
  * `activated`
  * `deactivated`
  * `close_date_updated`
  * `determined`
  * `settled`

  The existing `market_lifecycle_v2` channel continues to exclude `KXMVE`-prefixed tickers.

  **Affected channels:**

  * `multivariate_market_lifecycle`
  * `market_lifecycle_v2`
</Update>

<Update label="Mar 20, 2026">
  * `Trade.created_time` and `MarketPosition.last_updated_ts` are now required in the OpenAPI contract.
  * Deprecated compatibility fields on `Market` and `Settlement` remain available, but are no longer marked as required.
  * Fixed schema inconsistencies where `Trade.price` and `EventPosition.resting_orders_count` were listed as required without defined properties.
  * Added semantic deprecation markers for deprecated fields such as `EventData.category` and `MarketPosition.resting_orders_count`.
</Update>

<Update label="Mar 12, 2026">
  Two new event types added to the `market_lifecycle_v2` WebSocket channel:

  * **`fractional_trading_updated`**: emitted when a market's fractional trading setting is changed. Includes `fractional_trading_enabled` (boolean).
  * **`price_level_structure_updated`**: emitted when a market's price level structure is changed. Includes `price_level_structure` (string, e.g. `"linear_cent"`, `"deci_cent"`, `"tapered_deci_cent"`).

  Additionally, the `created` event now includes `fractional_trading_enabled` and `price_level_structure` fields.

<Update label="Mar 11, 2026">
  * The following legacy fields are temporarily restored to allow additional migration time. Their `_dollars` equivalents remain the recommended fields:
    * `market_positions` WebSocket: `position_cost`, `realized_pnl`, `fees_paid`, `position_fee_cost`
    * `GET /portfolio/settlements`: `yes_total_cost`, `no_total_cost`
  * `yes_bid_size_fp` and `yes_ask_size_fp` are now correctly populated on nested market responses (`GET /events/{ticker}`).
</Update>

<Update label="Mar 10, 2026">
  * `Fill` responses now expose `yes_price_dollars` and `no_price_dollars` to align with the API-wide `_dollars` naming convention. Legacy `yes_price_fixed` and `no_price_fixed` remain available for now but are deprecated.
  * `GET /portfolio/settlements` now exposes `yes_total_cost_dollars` and `no_total_cost_dollars` in fixed-point dollars.
  * Legacy settlement cent fields `yes_total_cost` and `no_total_cost` remain available for now because these `_dollars` fields were added late in the fixed-point migration, but clients are recommended to migrate now.

  See [Fixed-Point Migration](/getting_started/fixed_point_migration) for the recommended field mappings.

<Update label="Feb 19, 2026">
  Kalshi now partitions exchange data into **live** and **historical** tiers. Historical data must be accessed via the new historical API endpoints. The `GET /historical/cutoff` endpoint returns the cutoff timestamps that define this boundary.

  **Cutoff timestamps and what they mean:**

  * `market_settled_ts` — partitioned by **market settlement time**. Markets and their candlesticks that settled before this timestamp are only available via `GET /historical/markets` and `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks`.
  * `trades_created_ts` — partitioned by **trade fill time**. Fills that occurred before this timestamp are only available via `GET /historical/fills`.
  * `orders_updated_ts` — partitioned by **order cancellation or execution time**. Orders canceled or fully executed before this timestamp are only available via `GET /historical/orders`. **Resting (active) orders are unaffected** and always appear in `GET /portfolio/orders`.

  **New endpoints:**

  * `GET /historical/cutoff` — returns the market, trade, and order cutoff timestamps
  * `GET /historical/markets` — settled markets older than the cutoff
  * `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}` — single historical market by ticker
  * `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks` — candlestick data for historical markets
  * `GET /historical/fills` — trade fills older than the cutoff
  * `GET /historical/orders` — canceled/executed orders older than the cutoff

  **Impacted live endpoints:**

  * `GET /markets`, `GET /markets/{ticker}` — settled markets older than `market_settled_ts` will not appear
  * `GET /events` with `with_nested_markets=true` — nested markets older than `market_settled_ts` will not be included
  * `GET /series/{series_ticker}/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks`, `GET /markets/candlesticks` — candlestick data is tied to the market; historical markets' candlesticks must be fetched from `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks`
  * `GET /markets/trades`, `GET /portfolio/fills` — fills older than `trades_created_ts` will not appear
  * `GET /portfolio/orders` — completed/canceled orders older than `orders_updated_ts` will not appear (resting orders are unaffected)

  **FIX API v1.0.18**

  * Execution report precision extended for fractional shares
    * On qty fields, Kalshi will return at least a scale of 2 instead of 0.
    * E.g. on a trade which executes for 10 contracts, Kalshi will return `CumQty: 14=10.00` as opposed to `14=10`
    * Despite the change in precision, the numerical value will remain unchanged for now because fractional trading is not yet enabled on any market.
    * Affected fields: `LastQty`, `CumQty`, `LeavesQty`

    * QuoteConfirmStatus now uses tag 21010 (currently supporting both 297 and 21010)
    * SkipPendingExecReports now uses tag 21011 (currently accepting both 21003 and 21011)
    * Tag 297 designated for standard QuoteStatus field
    * Tag 21003 designated for ResendEventCount field
    * Clients should update to use new tags; legacy support will be removed in future version
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 30, 2025">
  **FIX API v1.0.16**

  * Added MaxExecutionCost (21009) NewOrderSingle flag.
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 29, 2025">
  `GET /live_data/{type}/milestone/{milestone_id}` and `GET /live_data/batch` now returns `milestone_id` in the response.

  Release date: `December 4, 2025`
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 23, 2025">
  Updates to filtering in `GET /markets`

  * Inactive markets during tradable hours will returned in the `open` selector.
  * Inactive markets during tradable hours no longer appear in the `closed` selector.
  * Restricting to a single status filter allowed per request (previously announced).

  Release date: `November 27, 2025`
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 21, 2025">
  Subpenny fields `yes_bid_dollars` and `no_bid_dollars` available on the Get Quote API. Affected endpoints:

  * `GET /communications/quotes`
  * `GET /communications/quotes/{quote_id}`
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 27, 2025">
  Adds new endpoint `GET /markets/candlesticks`

  Retrieve candlestick data for multiple markets in a single API call. Supports up to 10,000 candlesticks total across all requested markets.

  Expected release: `November 27, 2025`
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 21, 2025">
  **Breaking changes to order expiration and immediate-or-cancel (IoC) handling:**

  1. **Past expiration timestamps now rejected**: Orders with `expiration_ts` in the past will be rejected with error "Expiration timestamp must be in the future" instead of being automatically converted to IoC orders.

  2. **IoC + expiration\_ts combination rejected**: Orders cannot specify both `time_in_force: "immediate_or_cancel"` and `expiration_ts`. This will be rejected at the API level with error "Cannot specify both immediate\_or\_cancel and expiration\_ts".

  3. **IoC orders no longer support expiration**: The IoC order type is now independent and does not accept an expiration timestamp.

  **Migration guide**: If you were previously using past `expiration_ts` values to indicate IoC behavior, you must now explicitly set `time_in_force: "immediate_or_cancel"` instead.

  Expected release: `TBD`
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 21, 2025">
  **FIX API v1.0.15**

  * Added PreserveOriginalOrderQty (21008) Logon flag to maintain original OrderQty across all execution reports
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 20, 2025">
  'Pending' is being removed from the status enum on orders

  Expected release: `November 27, 2025`
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 14, 2025">
  `POST /portfolio/orders/batched` will now be generally available. Advanced API access is no longer a prerequisite.

  Release date: `November 20, 2025`
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 14, 2025">
  Added `created_time` to `GET /markets` && `GET /market` responses.

  Release date: `November 20, 2025`
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 11, 2025">
  Breaking changes planned to `GET /markets` endpoint for performance reasons:
  Timestamp filters will be mutually exclusive from other timestamp filters and certain status filters.

  | Compatible Timestamp Filters       | Additional Status Filters   |
  | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
  | min\_created\_ts, max\_created\_ts | `unopened`, `open`, *empty* |
  | min\_close\_ts, max\_close\_ts     | `closed`, *empty*           |
  | min\_settled\_ts, max\_settled\_ts | `settled`, *empty*          |
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 11, 2025">
  Added new timestamp filters for the `GET /markets` endpoint:

  * `min_created_ts`
  * `max_created_ts`
  * `min_settled_ts`
  * `max_settled_ts`
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 7, 2025">
  * `GET /portfolio/positions` will no longer return `resting_orders_count` in both the `event_positions` and `market_positions` field.
  * The `resting_order_count` filter on `GET /portfolio/positions` will no longer be supported. Requests specifying this filter will return a 400 error.

  Expected release: `November 13, 2025`
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 13, 2025">
  `GET /portfolio/settlements` now returns the sum of trade fees paid by the user on a settled market position.
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 6, 2025">
  Fixed two issues with the `GET /events` endpoint's `limit` parameter:

  * **Default increased**: The default limit is now 200 (previously 100) to return more results per page
  * **Parameter**: Requests with `with_nested_markets=true` now properly respect `limit=200` instead of being capped at 100
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 6, 2025">
  The `GET /portfolio/positions` endpoint now includes `total_cost_shares`, which tracks the total number of shares traded on an event (including both YES and NO contracts).
</Update>

<Update label="Nov 6, 2025">
  Added comprehensive support for multivariate events (combos) with new API endpoints and enhanced filtering:

  **New Endpoint and deprecation of multivariate events in GetEvents endpoint**

  * `GET /events/multivariate` - Retrieve multivariate events with filtering by series and collection ticker.
  * `GET /events` will EXCLUDE multivariate events upon the next release (November 13th). Please use the new endpoint!

  **Enhanced Market Filtering:**

  * `GET /markets` now supports `mve_filter` parameter:
    * `"only"` - Returns only multivariate events
    * `"exclude"` - Excludes multivariate events
    * No parameter - Returns all events (default behavior)

  Expected release: `November 6th, 2025`
</Update>

<Update label="Oct 24, 2025">
  Fixed batch order creation to return proper error details when post-only orders cross the market. The response now includes:

  * Error code: `"invalid order"`
  * Error details: `"post only cross"`

  This makes the batch endpoint consistent with single order creation and provides clear feedback on why post-only orders were rejected.
</Update>

<Update label="Oct 20, 2025">
  The `GET /portfolio/orders` endpoint's `event_ticker` parameter now supports filtering by multiple events using comma-separated values.

  **Example usage:**

  ```
  GET /portfolio/orders?event_ticker=EVENT1,EVENT2,EVENT3
  ```

  **Backward Compatible:**

  * Single event ticker queries continue to work as before
  * Multiple event tickers return orders from all specified events
</Update>

<Update label="Oct 19, 2025">
  Fixed missing fields in Quote responses: `rfq_target_cost_centi_cents`, `rfq_creator_order_id`, and `creator_order_id` are now properly included in all Quote-related endpoints.
</Update>

<Update label="Oct 16, 2025">
  The `GET /events` endpoint now supports an optional flag, `with_milestones`, that includes all milestones related to the returned events.

  Expected release: `October 16, 2025`
</Update>

<Update label="Oct 14, 2025">
  The order returned by create order is now the same model as the model returned by get order.
</Update>

<Update label="Oct 13, 2025">
  The `GET /v2/incentive_programs` and `GET /incentive_programs` endpoints now return a `series_ticker` field for each incentive program.

  Expected release: `October 13, 2025`
</Update>

<Update label="Oct 10, 2025">
  The `price_level_structure` field has been moved from the event level to the market level. Each market now has its own `price_level_structure` field.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/events`
  * `GET /trade-api/v2/events/:event_ticker`
  * `GET /trade-api/v2/markets`
  * `GET /trade-api/v2/markets/:ticker`

  **Note:** The `price_level_structure` field on event objects is now deprecated and will be removed. Please use the field on individual market objects instead.

  Expected release date: `Oct 15th, 2025`
</Update>

<Update label="Oct 13, 2025">
  Fixed the `GET /series` endpoint's tags parameter to properly support tags containing spaces. Previously, the parameter would split on both commas AND spaces, breaking searches for tags like "Rotten Tomatoes".

  **Breaking Change:**

  * The `tags` query parameter now **only** splits on commas (`,`), not spaces
  * Tags with spaces (e.g., "Rotten Tomatoes") now work correctly
  * Multiple tags must be comma-separated: `?tags=Rotten Tomatoes,Television`

  **Before (broken):**

  ```
  GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes
  // Was incorrectly parsed as: ["Rotten", "Tomatoes"]
  // Result: No matches found
  ```

  **After (fixed):**

  ```
  GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes
  // Correctly parsed as: ["Rotten Tomatoes"]
  // Result: Returns series with the "Rotten Tomatoes" tag

  GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes,Television
  // Correctly parsed as: ["Rotten Tomatoes", "Television"]
  // Result: Returns series with either tag
  ```

  This change may affect integrations that relied on space-separated tags. Please update to use comma-separated tags only.
</Update>

<Update label="Oct 8, 2025">
  Fixed routing inconsistency where certain collection endpoints required trailing slashes, causing unnecessary 301 redirects for requests without them.

  **Endpoints now returning 200 for requests without trailing slash** (previously returned 301):

  * `GET /milestones`
  * `GET /structured_targets`
  * `GET /multivariate_event_collections`
  * `GET /series`
  * `GET /api_keys`
  * `POST /api_keys`

  **Note:** Requests with trailing slashes (e.g., `/milestones/`) will now receive a 301 redirect to the version without the trailing slash, which is the opposite of the previous behavior.
</Update>

<Update label="Oct 9, 2025">
  Subpenny fields have been added to orders (`taker_fees_dollars`, `maker_fees_dollars`), as well as to public trades (`yes_price_dollars`, `no_price_dollars`).

  Endpoints affected:

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders`
  * `GET /trade-api/v2/markets/trades`
</Update>

<Update label="Oct 9, 2025">
  Fields have been added to all RFQ and quote messages to support subpenny pricing via the dollar normalized price fields.

</Update>

<Update label="Oct 7, 2025">
  Enhanced the existing `GET /portfolio/balance` endpoint to include a `portfolio_value` field that provides the total portfolio value (available balance plus current market value of all positions), both in cents.
</Update>

<Update label="Oct 1, 2025">
  The `GET /series/fee_changes` endpoint now returns user-facing fee type names (`quadratic`, `quadratic_with_maker_fees`, `flat`) instead of internal fee structure names. This change also applies to CustomerIO notifications for scheduled series fee updates.

  Expected release: `October 1, 2025`
</Update>

<Update label="Oct 1, 2025">
  **FIX API v1.0.14**

  * Added support for subpenny pricing across multiple FIX messages
  * For more info see [Subpenny Pricing](/fix/subpenny-pricing)
</Update>

<Update label="Sep 25, 2025">
  Repeated subscriptions on the same WebSocket call will no longer error. If passing
  the same market tickers as before, no action will be taken. If passing new market tickers,
  they will be added to your existing subscription.

  Additionally, the user may supply WS Command `list_subscriptions` to view their existing subscriptions.

  Expected release: `October 1, 2025`
</Update>

<Update label="Sep 25, 2025">
  For optimization purposes, partial fills generated by self-crossing FoK orders are not rolled back.
  If a FoK order self-crosses, order execution proceeds based on `self_trade_prevention_type`:

  * `taker_at_cross`: the taker is canceled, execution stops. Any partial fills are executed.
  * `maker`: the maker is canceled, execution continues. After execution, remaining taker quantity is canceled.
    Any fills are executed.

  This fixes a bug where partially filled FoK orders with Maker STP entered into the book after self-crossing.
  Expected enforced date: `Oct 1, 2025`.
</Update>

<Update label="Sep 22, 2025">
  User seeking a simple way to determine the direction of their fill should reference purchased\_side. Both BUY YES or SELL NO result in purchased\_side = YES. The addition of this field is the first step in standardizing the fills WebSocket and REST endpoints, which have different conventions for the interpretation 'side' and 'user\_action'.

  Expected Enforce Date: deprecation date for existing fields not yet scheduled.
</Update>

<Update label="Sep 21, 2025">
  Added new public API endpoint for getting all of a series' scheduled fees:

  * `GET /series/fee_changes` - Get a series' fee changes. If query string parameter show\_historical is set to true, ALL fee changes previous and upcoming will be shown. If set to false, only upcoming fee changes will be shown
</Update>

<Update label="Sep 25, 2025">
  Specifying `order_type` is no longer required and only `limit` type orders will be supported.
  Price must be supplied based on the underlying market structure. Example usage:

  ```
  {"yes_price": 99, "side: "yes"} // buy yes or sell no at market price
  {"no_price": 99, "side: "no"} // buy no or sell yes at market price
  ```

  Expected enforce date: `Sep 25, 2025`
</Update>

<Update label="Sep 18, 2025">
  WebSocket connections per user are limited by usage tier. The default limit begins at 200 and increases based on API usage tier.

</Update>

<Update label="Sep 15, 2025">
  Additional metadata is being added to RFQs on multivarate events (MVEs) that break down their component parts explicitly. Market payloads are also being expanded with these new optional fields that are filled only for MVE markets.
</Update>

<Update label="Sep 15, 2025">
  Added new public API endpoint for event candlesticks:

  * `GET /candlesticks` - Get candlesticks for all markets associated with an event. If the # of candlesticks exceeds 5000, paginate the results and return an adjustedEndTs which should be used as the start\_ts for your next request.
</Update>

<Update label="Sept 11, 2025">
  The TypeScript SDK is now available through NPM! Install with `npm install kalshi-typescript`.

  Documentation and examples available at docs.kalshi.com

</Update>

<Update label="Sep 10, 2025">
  Added new public API endpoint for incentive programs (not yet live):

  * `GET /incentive_programs` - List incentive programs with filtering options (by market ticker, active status, payout status)
</Update>

<Update label="Sep 9, 2025">
  Subpenny pricing fields have been added to WebSocket messages. Any message bearing price in cents will now also bear
  an equivalent fixed-point dollars field.

  For more info, see [Subpenny Pricing](/getting_started/subpenny_pricing).
</Update>

<Update label="Sep 9, 2025">
  Both the individual and batch `GET` events endpoints now also return `available_on_brokers` which indicates that they are available on intermediate platforms/ brokers.
</Update>

<Update label="Sep 6, 2025">
  The python SDK is being generated from our OpenAPI spec and is available through pip with pip install kalshi-python.
  Docs for the new SDK are available on docs.kalshi.com/python-sdk.
</Update>

<Update label="Aug 31, 2025">
  Subpenny pricing fields have been added to APIs involving price, fees, and money in general.
  E.g. next to a field called `"price": 12` (representing 12 cents), you will also see `"price_dollars": "0.1200"`,
  which is a string bearing a fixed-point representation of money accuate to at 4 decimal points.

  For now, this change is read-only, meaning that the minimum allowable tick size for orders is still 1c. Eventually,
  we will introduce sub-penny pricing on orders. For now, please prepare for an eventual migration to the higher granularity
  price representation.

  For more info, see [Subpenny Pricing](/getting_started/subpenny_pricing).

# Authentication & Sessions
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/fix-margin/authentication

API key creation, logon, session lifecycle, and message retransmission

## API Key Setup

FIX API keys use the same RSA key pair as the [REST API](/getting_started/api_keys). Generate a 2048-bit RSA key pair and register the public key in your [account profile](https://kalshi.com/account/profile). The resulting API Key ID (UUID) is your `SenderCompID`.

```bash theme={null}
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 -out kalshi-fix.key
openssl rsa -in kalshi-fix.key -pubout -out kalshi-fix.pub
```

## Logon (35=A)

The initiator sends a Logon message. The acceptor responds with either a Logon (success) or Logout (failure).

## Heartbeat & Sequence Numbers

| Behavior                             | Detail                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Default heartbeat interval           | 30 seconds                                                               |
| Missed heartbeat                     | Connection terminates if heartbeat response not received within interval |
| Sequence number lower than expected  | Connection terminated                                                    |
| Sequence number higher than expected | Recoverable with ResendRequest (KalshiRT only)                           |

## Message Retransmission

Message retransmission (ResendRequest, SequenceReset) is only supported on **KalshiRT**. `ResetSeqNumFlag<141>` must always be `Y` on KalshiNR and KalshiDC.

The [drop copy session](/fix-margin/drop-copy) provides an alternative way to query for missed execution reports. For a real-time streaming feed, see [Listener Sessions](/fix-margin/listener-sessions).

### ResendRequest (35=2)

**KalshiRT only.** Lookback window controlled by `MessageRetentionPeriod`.

| Tag | Name       | Description             |
| --- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| 7   | BeginSeqNo | Lower bound (inclusive) |
| 16  | EndSeqNo   | Upper bound (inclusive) |

## Logout (35=5)

Either side may initiate a Logout. The counterparty responds with a Logout, and the transport connection is terminated. If `CancelOrdersOnDisconnect=Y` was set on Logon, all open orders are canceled.

## Session Configuration

All connections use **FIXT.1.1** with application version **FIX50SP2**.

| Parameter    | Value                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| SenderCompID | Your FIX API key (UUID format)                           |
| TargetCompID | One of `KalshiNR`, `KalshiRT`, `KalshiDC`, or `KalshiMD` |
| Session ID   | `TargetCompID + SenderCompID`                            |

Only one FIX connection is allowed per API key. Separate API keys are required for concurrent connections.

## SSL/TLS

You must use TLS 1.2 or higher (not plain TCP) to connect to the margin FIX gateway. Cipher suites follow [AWS Network Load Balancer TLS policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-tls-listener.html#describe-ssl-policies). If your FIX implementation does not support native TLS connections, use a local proxy such as [stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/).

To obtain the server certificate for pinning on the initiator side:

```bash theme={null}
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <host>:<port> < /dev/null | openssl x509 > kalshi-fix.pem
```

## Private Connectivity

For participants requiring network-level isolation, Kalshi supports private connectivity via [AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/what-is-privatelink.html). With PrivateLink, FIX traffic is routed entirely within the AWS backbone and never traverses the public internet.

Members on the Premier tier or above can contact [institutional@kalshi.com](mailto:institutional@kalshi.com) to provision a PrivateLink endpoint for their AWS account.

## Rate Limits

* **Limit**: FIX application messages use the same token model, token costs, and margin Read/Write buckets as the equivalent REST API operations.
* **Scope**: Application messages only (from client to server)
* **Excluded**: Logout (35=5), Heartbeat (35=0), TestRequest (35=1)
* Logon (35=A) **is** rate-limited.
* Order-entry messages use the margin Write bucket. See [Rate Limits and Tiers](/getting_started/rate_limits) for tier budgets and token-cost behavior.
* Mass Cancel Request (35=q) is limited to 1 request/second.

## Maintenance Window

See [Maintenance and Pauses](/getting_started/maintenance_and_pauses) for scheduled maintenance times and the difference between trading pauses and exchange pauses.

Sessions may be disconnected during the maintenance window. Kalshi does not initiate sequence number resets during maintenance; clients should reset sequence numbers on their side when reconnecting.

KalshiRT sessions retain message continuity across the maintenance window. If your KalshiRT session is disconnected, you can request retransmission of any messages missed during the downtime after reconnecting.

### CancelOrderOnPause

To control what happens to your resting orders during a [pause](/getting_started/maintenance_and_pauses), set tag `21006` (CancelOrderOnPause) on your **New Order Single (35=D)** messages:

| Value       | Behavior                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Y           | Order is automatically cancelled when a trading or exchange pause begins |
| N (default) | Order remains resting on the book and resumes when activity reopens      |


# Drop Copy Session
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/fix-margin/drop-copy

Recover missed margin execution reports and query historical order events

<Warning>
  **This is not a traditional drop copy session.** Kalshi's Drop Copy uses a request-response pattern for querying historical execution reports. For a real-time streaming feed, use a [Listener Session](/fix-margin/listener-sessions) on KalshiRT instead.
</Warning>

Lookback window is limited to the last 3 hours. Only ExecutionReport (35=8) messages are returned. Rejects and pending orders (ExecID `"-1;-1"`) are excluded.

<Note>
  Resent messages have new FIX sequence numbers, different from their original numbers on the trading session. Use ExecID to reconcile.
</Note>

## EventResendRequest (35=U1)

Request execution reports within a specified ExecID range.

| Tag   | Name        | Description                                                      | Required |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 21001 | BeginExecID | Starting ExecID (inclusive)                                      | Yes      |
| 21002 | EndExecID   | Ending ExecID (inclusive). Defaults to latest ExecID if omitted. | No       |

**Example:**

```fix theme={null}
8=FIXT.1.1|35=U1|21001=12345;67890|21002=12350;67895|
```

## EventResendComplete (35=U2)

Sent after all requested events have been resent.

| Tag   | Name             | Description                         | Required |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| 45    | RefSeqNum        | MsgSeqNum of the EventResendRequest | Yes      |
| 21003 | ResendEventCount | Total number of events resent       | Yes      |

## EventResendReject (35=U3)

Sent when a resend request cannot be fulfilled.

| Tag   | Name                    | Description                                                                                                                         | Required |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 45    | RefSeqNum               | MsgSeqNum of the EventResendRequest                                                                                                 | Yes      |
| 21004 | EventResendRejectReason | Rejection code: `1`=Too many resend requests, `2`=Server error, `3`=BeginExecID too small (outside window), `4`=EndExecID too large | Yes      |


# Error Handling
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/fix-margin/error-handling

Understanding and handling errors on margin FIX sessions

## Overview

Margin FIX uses standard FIX error messages with additional detail in the Text field. Errors fall into two categories:

* **Session-level errors**: Protocol violations, handled with Reject (35=3)
* **Business-level errors**: Application logic issues, handled with BusinessMessageReject (35=j) or order-specific rejection messages

## Error Message Types

### Reject (35=3)

Used for session-level protocol violations.

| Tag | Name                | Description                         | Required |

## Order-Specific Rejections

### Order Reject Reasons (103)

In ExecutionReport (35=8) with `ExecType=Rejected`:

| Code | Reason                           | Common Causes                             |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Unknown symbol                   | Invalid margin market ticker              |
| 2    | Exchange closed                  | Trading paused or unavailable             |
| 3    | Order exceeds limit              | Risk limit breach or insufficient margin  |
| 4    | Too late to enter                | Market not accepting new orders           |
| 5    | Stale order                      | Expired timestamp on request              |
| 6    | Duplicate order                  | ClOrdID already used                      |
| 11   | Unsupported order characteristic | Invalid order parameters                  |
| 13   | Incorrect quantity               | Invalid order size                        |
| 15   | Unknown account                  | Subaccount not found or permission denied |
| 99   | Other                            | See Text field                            |

### Cancel Reject Reasons (102)

In OrderCancelReject (35=9):

| Code | Reason             | Description                                 |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Too late to cancel | Order already filled                        |
| 1    | Unknown order      | Order not found or identifiers do not match |
| 99   | Other              | See Text field                              |

## Common Error Scenarios

**Example: Invalid Tag**

```fix theme={null}
// Sent
8=FIXT.1.1|35=D|11=123|38=10|333333=test|...

// Response: Reject
8=FIXT.1.1|35=3|45=5|58=Undefined tag received|371=333333|372=D|373=3|
```

**Example: Order Rejected by Exchange**

```fix theme={null}
// Sent
8=FIXT.1.1|35=D|11=456|38=10|55=BTC-PERP|44=19.5000|...

// Response: ExecutionReport (Rejected)
8=FIXT.1.1|35=8|11=456|150=8|39=8|58=EXCHANGE_PAUSED|103=2|...
```

<Note>
  Order-entry failures returned by the exchange are sent as ExecutionReport (35=8) with ExecType=Rejected, not as BusinessMessageReject. BusinessMessageReject (35=j) is used for application-layer failures before normal exchange rejection handling, such as rate limiting or listener-session restrictions.
</Note>

**Example: Insufficient Balance**

```fix theme={null}
// Response: ExecutionReport
8=FIXT.1.1|35=8|11=789|150=8|39=8|58=INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE|103=3|...
```

## Troubleshooting

### MsgSeqNum Too High on Logon

**Symptom**: Logon fails or the server sends a ResendRequest for messages the client doesn't have.

**Cause**: The client is sending a `MsgSeqNum` higher than what the server last saw. This typically happens when the client's local sequence store persists across sessions but the server has reset (e.g. after maintenance or a prior `ResetSeqNumFlag=Y` logon).

**Fix**:

* **KalshiNR, KalshiDC**: Set `ResetSeqNumFlag<141>=Y` on every Logon. These sessions require it; Logon will be rejected without it.
* **KalshiRT**: If you don't need to recover missed messages, set `ResetSeqNumFlag<141>=Y` to reset both sides to 1. If you do need retransmission continuity, ensure your local sequence store matches the server's state.

If using QuickFIX, set `ResetOnLogon=Y` in your session config for non-retransmission sessions.

### SendingTime Rejected

**Symptom**: Reject (35=3) with `SessionRejectReason<373>=10`.

**Cause**: The client's clock is more than 30 seconds off from the server. Sync your system clock via NTP.

### Duplicate Session ("already exists")

**Symptom**: Logout (35=5) immediately after Logon with `Text<58>="already exists"`.

**Cause**: Another FIX connection is already active with the same API key and TargetCompID. Only one connection is allowed per API key per session type. This can also occur if a previous connection was not cleanly closed and the server hasn't yet detected the disconnect.

**Fix**: Ensure the previous session is fully disconnected before reconnecting. If the prior connection was lost unexpectedly, wait for the server's heartbeat timeout to expire (up to 60 seconds depending on your `HeartbeatInt` setting) before retrying. Use separate API keys for concurrent connections.

### Logon Signature Rejected

**Symptom**: Logout immediately after Logon with a signature error.

**Cause**: The `SendingTime` used in the pre-hash string doesn't match the `SendingTime<52>` in the actual Logon message. If using a FIX library, the library may auto-populate `SendingTime`. Use that exact value when computing the signature, not a separately generated timestamp.


# Listener Sessions
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/fix-margin/listener-sessions

Real-time read-only feed of margin execution reports from your trading session

## Overview

A listener session provides a **real-time, read-only stream** of execution reports from your margin trading session. This is what most exchanges refer to as a "drop copy": a live shadow feed of all fills and order state changes. Kalshi's [Drop Copy session](/fix-margin/drop-copy) (KalshiDC) is a separate request-response tool for querying historical execution reports, not a live feed.

## How It Works

A listener session is not a separate endpoint. It is a **mode** enabled on a standard KalshiNR or KalshiRT order entry session by setting `ListenerSession=Y` (tag 20126) during Logon.

Once connected, the listener session receives the same execution reports as your active trading session in real time, but **cannot send any orders or modifications**.

Listener sessions connect to the same KalshiNR or KalshiRT endpoints listed on the [Connectivity](/fix-margin/connectivity) page. A **separate API key** is required (read-only scope is sufficient).

## Logon Configuration

### Required Logon Fields

| Tag   | Name                   | Value | Description                     |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------- |
| 20126 | ListenerSession        | Y     | Enables listen-only mode        |
| 21011 | SkipPendingExecReports | Y     | Required when ListenerSession=Y |

### Restrictions

The following Logon flags are **not compatible** with listener sessions:

| Tag  | Name                     | Restriction            |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 8013 | CancelOrdersOnDisconnect | Must be N (or omitted) |

## What You Receive

Listener sessions receive **ExecutionReport (35=8)** messages for all order activity on your account, including:

* New order acknowledgements
* Fills and partial fills
* Order cancellations
* Order replacements

## What You Cannot Do

Listener sessions are strictly read-only. The following message types will be **rejected**:

* NewOrderSingle (35=D)
* OrderCancelRequest (35=F)
* OrderCancelReplaceRequest (35=G)
* OrderMassCancelRequest (35=q)


# Market Data
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/fix-margin/market-data

Request margin order book snapshots and incremental updates through FIX

Market data is available on the dedicated **KalshiMD** session. It supports order book snapshots and incremental updates for margin markets. Subscriptions are identified by `Symbol<55>`.

`KalshiMD` does not support message retransmission. Use `ResetSeqNumFlag<141>=Y` on Logon.

# Authentication & Sessions
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/fix/authentication

API key creation, logon, session lifecycle, and message retransmission

## API Key Setup

FIX API keys use the same RSA key pair as the [REST API](/getting_started/api_keys). Generate a 2048-bit RSA key pair and register the public key in your [account profile](https://kalshi.com/account/profile). The resulting API Key ID (UUID) is your `SenderCompID`.

```bash theme={null}
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 -out kalshi-fix.key
openssl rsa -in kalshi-fix.key -pubout -out kalshi-fix.pub
```

## Logon (35=A)

The initiator sends a Logon message. The acceptor responds with either a Logon (success) or Logout (failure).

### Required Fields

| Tag  | Name             | Description                    | Value                    |

### Signature Generation

The RawData field must contain a PSS RSA signature of the pre-hash string:

```
PreHashString = SendingTime + SOH + MsgType + SOH + MsgSeqNum + SOH + SenderCompID + SOH + TargetCompID
```

<Warning>
  **SendingTime in Signature**

  The SendingTime in the PreHashString must match **exactly** the value in field 52 of the Logon message. Format: `YYYYMMDD-HH:MM:SS.mmm`.

  SendingTime must be within 30 seconds of the server's current time, or the message will be rejected with `SessionRejectReason<373>=10`.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  from base64 import b64encode
  from Cryptodome.Signature import pss
  from Cryptodome.Hash import SHA256
  from Cryptodome.PublicKey import RSA

  private_key = RSA.import_key(open('kalshi-fix.key').read().encode('utf-8'))

  sending_time = "20230809-05:28:18.035"
  msg_type = "A"
  msg_seq_num = "1"

## Heartbeat & Sequence Numbers

| Behavior                             | Detail                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Default heartbeat interval           | 30 seconds                                                               |
| Missed heartbeat                     | Connection terminates if heartbeat response not received within interval |
| Sequence number lower than expected  | Connection terminated                                                    |
| Sequence number higher than expected | Recoverable with ResendRequest (KalshiRT, KalshiPT only)                 |

## Message Retransmission

Message retransmission (ResendRequest, SequenceReset) is only supported on **KalshiRT** and **KalshiPT**.

<Warning>
  For all other sessions, `ResetSeqNumFlag<141>` in the Logon message must always be `Y` or the Logon will be rejected.
</Warning>

The [drop copy session](/fix/drop-copy) provides an alternative way to query for missed execution reports. For a real-time streaming feed, see [Listener Sessions](/fix/listener-sessions).

### ResendRequest (35=2)

**KalshiRT and KalshiPT only.** Lookback window limited to 24 hours (or up to 72 hours if `MessageRetentionPeriod` was set on Logon).

| Tag | Name       | Description             |
| --- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| 7   | BeginSeqNo | Lower bound (inclusive) |
| 16  | EndSeqNo   | Upper bound (inclusive) |

## Logout (35=5)

Either side may initiate a Logout. The counterparty responds with a Logout, and the transport connection is terminated. If `CancelOrdersOnDisconnect=Y` was set on Logon, all open orders are canceled.

<Note>
  If you are using a FIX engine such as [QuickFIX/J](https://www.quickfixj.org/), [QuickFIX/N](https://quickfixn.readthedocs.io/), or [quickfix-go](https://github.com/quickfixgo/quickfix), the standard header and trailer fields below are managed automatically by the library. This section is primarily a reference for custom implementations or debugging.
</Note>

## Standard Header

Every FIX message begins with the following fields:

| Tag | Name            | Type         | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| --- | --------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 8   | BeginString     | String       | Y        | Always `FIXT.1.1`                                                                                                                                                   |
| 9   | BodyLength      | Int          | Y        | Message length in bytes, from the tag after BodyLength up to (but not including) the CheckSum field. Must be the second field.                                      |
| 35  | MsgType         | String       | Y        | Identifies the message type. Must be the third field.                                                                                                               |
| 49  | SenderCompID    | String       | Y        | Your FIX API Key (UUID format) when sending; `Kalshi` when receiving.                                                                                               |
| 56  | TargetCompID    | String       | Y        | Session identifier (e.g. `KalshiRT`, `KalshiNR`) when sending; your API key when receiving.                                                                         |
| 34  | MsgSeqNum       | Int          | Y        | Monotonically increasing sequence number, starting at 1.                                                                                                            |
| 52  | SendingTime     | UTCTimestamp | Y        | Time the message was sent, in UTC. Format: `YYYYMMDD-HH:MM:SS.mmm`. Must be within 30 seconds of server time or the message is rejected (`SessionRejectReason=10`). |
| 43  | PossDupFlag     | Boolean      | N        | `Y` if the message is a possible duplicate of a previously sent message (used during retransmission).                                                               |
| 97  | PossResend      | Boolean      | N        | `Y` if the message may contain information that has already been sent under a different sequence number.                                                            |
| 122 | OrigSendingTime | UTCTimestamp | N        | Original SendingTime of a message being resent. Required when `PossDupFlag=Y`.                                                                                      |

## Standard Trailer

Every FIX message ends with:

| Tag | Name     | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --- | -------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10  | CheckSum | String | Y        | Three-character checksum. Calculated by summing every byte in the message up to (but not including) the CheckSum field, then taking modulo 256. Always three digits, zero-padded (e.g. `007`). |

## Session Configuration

All connections use **FIXT.1.1** with application version **FIX50SP2**.

| Parameter    | Value                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| SenderCompID | Your FIX API Key (UUID format) |
| TargetCompID | See endpoints table above      |
| Session ID   | `TargetCompID + SenderCompID`  |

Only one FIX connection is allowed per API key. Separate API keys are required for concurrent connections.

## SSL/TLS

You must use TLS 1.2 or higher (not plain TCP) to connect to the FIX gateway. Cipher suites follow [AWS Network Load Balancer TLS policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-tls-listener.html#describe-ssl-policies). If your FIX implementation does not support native TLS connections, use a local proxy such as [stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/).

To obtain the server certificate for pinning on the initiator side:

```bash theme={null}
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <host>:<port> < /dev/null | openssl x509 > kalshi-fix.pem
```

For example, to pin against the demo order entry endpoint:

```bash theme={null}
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect fix.demo.kalshi.co:8228 < /dev/null | openssl x509 > kalshi-fix.pem
```

## Private Connectivity

For participants requiring network-level isolation, Kalshi supports private connectivity via [AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/what-is-privatelink.html). With PrivateLink, FIX traffic is routed entirely within the AWS backbone and never traverses the public internet.

Members on the Premier tier or above can contact [institutional@kalshi.com](mailto:institutional@kalshi.com) to provision a PrivateLink endpoint for their AWS account.

## Rate Limits

* **Limit**: FIX application messages use the same token model, token costs, and Read/Write buckets as the equivalent REST API operations.
* **Scope**: Application messages only (from client to server)
* **Excluded**: Logout (35=5), Heartbeat (35=0), TestRequest (35=1)
* Logon (35=A) **is** rate-limited.
* Order-entry and RFQ messages use the Write bucket. See [Rate Limits and Tiers](/getting_started/rate_limits) for tier budgets and token-cost behavior.
* Mass Cancel Request (35=q) is limited to 1 request/second.

## Maintenance Window

See [Maintenance and Pauses](/getting_started/maintenance_and_pauses) for scheduled maintenance times and the difference between trading pauses and exchange pauses.

Sessions may be disconnected during the maintenance window. Kalshi does not initiate sequence number resets during maintenance; clients should reset sequence numbers on their side when reconnecting.

KalshiRT sessions retain message continuity across the maintenance window. If your KalshiRT session is disconnected, you can request retransmission of any messages missed during the downtime after reconnecting.

### CancelOrderOnPause

To control what happens to your resting orders during a [pause](/getting_started/maintenance_and_pauses), set tag `21006` (CancelOrderOnPause) on your **New Order Single (35=D)** messages:

| Value       | Behavior                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Y           | Order is automatically cancelled when a trading or exchange pause begins |
| N (default) | Order remains resting on the book and resumes when activity reopens      |


# Drop Copy Session
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/fix/drop-copy

Recover missed execution reports and query historical order events

<Warning>
  **This is not a traditional drop copy session.** Kalshi's Drop Copy uses a request-response pattern for querying historical execution reports. For a real-time streaming feed, use a [Listener Session](/fix/listener-sessions) on KalshiRT instead.
</Warning>

Lookback window is limited to the last 3 hours. Only ExecutionReport (35=8) messages are returned. Rejects and pending orders (ExecID `"-1;-1"`) are excluded.

<Note>
  Resent messages have new FIX sequence numbers, different from their original numbers on the order entry session. Use ExecID to reconcile.
</Note>

## EventResendRequest (35=U1)

Request execution reports within a specified ExecID range.

ExecID format is `clock;event` for exchange index `0` and `clock;event;exchange_index` for other indexes. Resend ranges are scoped to one exchange index; `EndExecID`, if provided, must use the same exchange index as `BeginExecID`.

| Tag   | Name        | Description                                                                                 | Required |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 21001 | BeginExecID | Starting ExecID (inclusive)                                                                 | Yes      |
| 21002 | EndExecID   | Ending ExecID (inclusive). Defaults to latest ExecID on the same exchange index if omitted. | No       |

**Example:**

```fix theme={null}
8=FIXT.1.1|35=U1|21001=12345;67890|21002=12350;67895|
```

## EventResendComplete (35=U2)

Sent after all requested events have been resent.

| Tag   | Name             | Description                         | Required |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| 45    | RefSeqNum        | MsgSeqNum of the EventResendRequest | Yes      |
| 21003 | ResendEventCount | Total number of events resent       | Yes      |

## EventResendReject (35=U3)

Sent when a resend request cannot be fulfilled.

| Tag   | Name                    | Description                                                                                                                         | Required |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 45    | RefSeqNum               | MsgSeqNum of the EventResendRequest                                                                                                 | Yes      |
| 21004 | EventResendRejectReason | Rejection code: `1`=Too many resend requests, `2`=Server error, `3`=BeginExecID too small (outside window), `4`=EndExecID too large | Yes      |


# Error Handling
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/fix/error-handling

Understanding and handling errors in the FIX protocol

## Overview

Kalshi FIX API uses standard FIX error messages with additional detail in the Text field. Errors fall into two categories:

* **Session-level errors**: Protocol violations, handled with Reject (35=3)
* **Business-level errors**: Application logic issues, handled with BusinessMessageReject (35=j) or specific rejection messages

## Error Message Types

### Cancel Reject Reasons (102)

In OrderCancelReject (35=9):

| Code | Reason                  | Description                                                              |

## Common Error Scenarios

**Example: Invalid Tag**

**Scenario**: Undefined tag in NewOrderSingle

```fix theme={null}
// Sent
8=FIXT.1.1|35=D|11=123|38=10|333333=test|...

// Response: Reject
8=FIXT.1.1|35=3|45=5|58=Undefined tag received|371=333333|372=D|373=3|
```

**Example: Order Rejected by Exchange**

**Scenario**: Trading during maintenance

```fix theme={null}
// Sent
8=FIXT.1.1|35=D|11=456|38=10|55=HIGHNY-23DEC31|...

// Response: ExecutionReport (Rejected)
8=FIXT.1.1|35=8|11=456|150=8|39=8|58=EXCHANGE_PAUSED|103=2|...
```

<Note>
  Order-entry failures returned by the exchange are sent as ExecutionReport (35=8) with ExecType=Rejected, not as BusinessMessageReject. BusinessMessageReject (35=j) is used for application-layer failures before normal exchange rejection handling, such as rate limiting or listener-session restrictions.
</Note>

**Example: Insufficient Balance**

```fix theme={null}
// Response: ExecutionReport
8=FIXT.1.1|35=8|11=789|150=8|39=8|58=INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE|103=3|...
```

## Troubleshooting

### MsgSeqNum Too High on Logon

**Symptom**: Logon fails or the server sends a ResendRequest for messages the client doesn't have.

**Cause**: The client is sending a `MsgSeqNum` higher than what the server last saw. This typically happens when the client's local sequence store persists across sessions but the server has reset (e.g. after maintenance or a prior `ResetSeqNumFlag=Y` logon).

**Fix**:

* **KalshiNR, KalshiDC, KalshiRFQ, KalshiMD**: Set `ResetSeqNumFlag<141>=Y` on every Logon. These sessions require it; Logon will be rejected without it.
* **KalshiRT, KalshiPT**: If you don't need to recover missed messages, set `ResetSeqNumFlag<141>=Y` to reset both sides to 1. If you do need retransmission continuity, ensure your local sequence store matches the server's state.

If using QuickFIX, set `ResetOnLogon=Y` in your session config for non-retransmission sessions.

### SendingTime Rejected

**Symptom**: Reject (35=3) with `SessionRejectReason<373>=10`.

**Cause**: The client's clock is more than 30 seconds off from the server. Sync your system clock via NTP.

### Duplicate Session ("already exists")

**Symptom**: Logout (35=5) immediately after Logon with `Text<58>="already exists"`.

**Cause**: Another FIX connection is already active with the same API key. Only one connection is allowed per API key. This can also occur if a previous connection was not cleanly closed and the server hasn't yet detected the disconnect.

**Fix**: Ensure the previous session is fully disconnected before reconnecting. If the prior connection was lost unexpectedly, wait for the server's heartbeat timeout to expire (up to 60 seconds depending on your `HeartbeatInt` setting) before retrying. Use separate API keys for concurrent connections.

### Logon Signature Rejected

**Symptom**: Logout immediately after Logon with a signature error.

**Cause**: The `SendingTime` used in the pre-hash string doesn't match the `SendingTime<52>` in the actual Logon message. If using a FIX library, the library may auto-populate `SendingTime`. Use that exact value when computing the signature, not a separately generated timestamp.


# Listener Sessions
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/fix/listener-sessions

Real-time read-only feed of execution reports from your trading session

## Overview

A listener session provides a **real-time, read-only stream** of execution reports from your trading session. This is what most exchanges refer to as a "drop copy": a live shadow feed of all fills and order state changes. Kalshi's [Drop Copy session](/fix/drop-copy) (KalshiDC) is a separate request-response tool for querying historical execution reports, not a live feed.

## How It Works

A listener session is not a separate endpoint. It is a **mode** enabled on a standard KalshiNR or KalshiRT order entry session by setting `ListenerSession=Y` (tag 20126) during Logon.

Once connected, the listener session receives the same execution reports as your active trading session in real time, but **cannot send any orders or modifications**.

Listener sessions connect to the same KalshiNR or KalshiRT endpoints listed on the [Connectivity](/fix/connectivity) page. A **separate API key** is required (read-only scope is sufficient).

## Logon Configuration

### Required Logon Fields

| Tag   | Name                   | Value | Description                     |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------- |
| 20126 | ListenerSession        | Y     | Enables listen-only mode        |
| 21011 | SkipPendingExecReports | Y     | Required when ListenerSession=Y |

### Restrictions

The following Logon flags are **not compatible** with listener sessions:

| Tag  | Name                     | Restriction            |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 8013 | CancelOrdersOnDisconnect | Must be N (or omitted) |

**Example Logon:**

```fix theme={null}
8=FIXT.1.1|35=A|98=0|108=30|1137=9|20126=Y|21011=Y|96=<signature>|
```

## What You Receive

Listener sessions receive **ExecutionReport (35=8)** messages for all order activity on your account, including:

* New order acknowledgements
* Fills and partial fills
* Order cancellations
* Order replacements

## What You Cannot Do

Listener sessions are strictly read-only. The following message types will be **rejected**:

* NewOrderSingle (35=D)
* OrderCancelRequest (35=F)
* OrderCancelReplaceRequest (35=G)
* OrderMassCancelRequest (35=q)
* QuoteRequest / RFQ creation
* Quote acceptance


# Market Data
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/fix/market-data

Request order book snapshots and incremental updates through FIX

Market data is available on the dedicated **KalshiMD** session. It supports order book snapshots, incremental updates, and per-market trading-status changes via [Security Status](#security-status). Subscriptions are identified by `Symbol<55>`.

`KalshiMD` does not support message retransmission. Use `ResetSeqNumFlag<141>=Y` on Logon.

## Message Flow

```mermaid theme={null}

## Example Settlement Report

```fix theme={null}
// Market settled as "yes", no fees
8=FIXT.1.1|35=UMS|
20105=settle-123|55=HIGHNY-23DEC31|715=20231231|
20107=yes|730=100.00|
20108=1|
  20109=user-456|20110=24|
  704=100|705=0|
  1703=1|
    1704=100.00|1705=PAYOUT|
  136=1|
    137=0.00|138=USD|139=4|891=0|
893=Y|
```

```fix theme={null}
// Market settled as "yes", with sub-cent rounding fee
8=FIXT.1.1|35=UMS|
20105=settle-456|55=HIGHNY-23DEC31|715=20231231|
20107=yes|730=100.00|
20108=1|

  704=100|705=0|
  1703=1|

  136=1|
    137=0.006|138=USD|139=4|891=0|
893=Y|
```

The first example shows:

* Market HIGHNY-23DEC31 settled as "yes"
* User held 100 Yes contracts
* Received \$100.00 payout to balance
* Zero settlement fees

The second example shows:

* Same market, different user
* $100.00 payout with a $0.006 rounding fee

## Pagination

Large settlement batches may span multiple messages:

| Tag   | Use Case                                  |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 20106 | Total number of reports in batch          |
| 893   | LastFragment=N for more pages, Y for last |

<Warning>
  **Important:** The `MarketSettlementReportID` (tag 20105) will be different across paginated responses.
  Each page of results generates a new unique settlement ID. Use the `Symbol` (tag 55) ticker to identify fragments belonging to the same paginated settlement.

### Collateral Changes

| Tag  | Name                      | Description                  |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1703 | NoCollateralAmountChanges | Number of collateral changes |
| 1704 | CollateralAmountChange    | Delta in dollars             |
| 1705 | CollateralAmountType      | BALANCE or PAYOUT            |

### Collateral Return Breakdown

When Logon tag `21027` (`SplitCollateralReturn`) is set to `Y`, Execution Reports with `ExecType=Trade` include:

| Tag   | Name                         | Type    | Description                                                                                                   |

| 21031 | RangedMarketCollateralReturn | Decimal | Collateral freed from MECNET/DIRECNET netting across a market group. In dollars. Only present when non-zero.  |

Both values are informational subsets of the `BALANCE` collateral change — they describe components within the total balance delta, not additional amounts.

### Party Information

Party fields from the original order request are echoed back in ExecutionReports:

| Tag | Name         | Description                          |

# Order Groups
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/fix/order-groups

Manage order groups for automatic position management

For an overview of order groups and how they work, see [Order Groups](/getting_started/order_groups).

## Order Group Request (35=UOG)

Manage order groups with Create, Reset, Delete, Trigger, and Update operations.

### Required Fields

| Tag   | Name             | Description          | Type/Values                                                |
| ----- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20131 | OrderGroupAction | Operation to perform | Create\<1>, Reset\<2>, Delete\<3>, Trigger\<4>, Update\<5> |

### Optional Fields

| Tag | Name          | Description                                                                                                                                                                    | Type/Values |
| --- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| 79  | AllocAccount  | Subaccount number (0-63). When provided on any action, the request targets the order group belonging to that subaccount. Omit (or set to 0) to operate on the primary account. | Integer     |
| 100 | ExDestination | Exchange index. Omit for exchange index `0`.                                                                                                                                   | Integer     |

<Note>
  Order groups are scoped per subaccount. An `OrderGroupID` created under `AllocAccount=2` cannot be reset, updated, deleted, or triggered without also passing `AllocAccount=2` on the follow-up request. If the AllocAccount value does not match the group's owning subaccount, the exchange returns an `ORDER_GROUP_NOT_FOUND` business reject.
</Note>

### Fields by Action

#### Create (Action=1)

| Tag   | Name                     | Description                                    | Required |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------- |

| 79    | AllocAccount             | Subaccount number (0-63) to own the new group. | No       |

<Note>
  The OrderGroupID is generated by the server and returned in the response. Do not include tag 20130 in Create requests.
</Note>

#### Reset (Action=2)

| Tag   | Name         | Description                                   | Required |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 20130 | OrderGroupID | ID of group to reset                          | Yes      |
| 79    | AllocAccount | Subaccount number (0-63) that owns the group. | No       |

#### Delete (Action=3)

| Tag   | Name         | Description                                   | Required |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 20130 | OrderGroupID | ID of group to delete                         | Yes      |
| 79    | AllocAccount | Subaccount number (0-63) that owns the group. | No       |

<Warning>
  Deleting an order group cancels all resting orders in that group.
</Warning>

#### Trigger (Action=4)

| Tag   | Name         | Description                                   | Required |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 20130 | OrderGroupID | ID of group to trigger                        | Yes      |
| 79    | AllocAccount | Subaccount number (0-63) that owns the group. | No       |

<Warning>
  The Trigger action immediately cancels all orders in the specified order group, regardless of whether the contracts limit has been reached. This is useful for manual risk management or emergency order cancellation.
</Warning>

#### Update (Action=5)

| Tag   | Name                     | Description                                   | Required |
| ----- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 20130 | OrderGroupID             | ID of group to update                         | Yes      |
| 20132 | OrderGroupContractsLimit | New maximum contracts allowed (1-1,000,000)   | Yes      |
| 79    | AllocAccount             | Subaccount number (0-63) that owns the group. | No       |

<Note>
  If the updated limit would immediately trigger the group (based on the rolling 15-second window), the server cancels all
  orders in the group and marks it as triggered. No new orders can be placed until the group is reset.
</Note>

# RFQ
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/fix/rfq-messages

Request for Quote functionality for RFQ creators and market makers

## Overview

RFQ functionality involves two types of participants connecting via different FIX sessions:

**RFQ Creators** - Users who want to trade via RFQ (connect via **RT mode**):

1. Create RFQ via QuoteRequest (35=R)
2. Receive quotes from market makers via Quote (35=S)
3. Accept a quote via AcceptQuote (35=UA)
4. Receive trade execution via ExecutionReport (35=8)

**Market Makers** - Users who provide quotes (connect via **RfqMode**):

1. Receive QuoteRequest from exchange
2. Respond with Quote (35=S)
3. Receive acceptance notification
4. Confirm execution via QuoteConfirm (35=U7)

<Info>
  RFQ Creators use the KalshiRT endpoint (same as order entry), which provides message persistence and retransmission support. Market Makers use the KalshiRFQ endpoint to receive RFQ broadcasts and submit quotes.

<Note>
  The delimiter is the first tag of a group entry: send `146`, then `55` for a symbol RFQ
  or `38`/`152` for an MVE RFQ (which omits `55`). Note that `21015` and `21016` are
  dropped without a reject if they land outside the group — a misplaced `21016` surfaces
  later as `RFQ already exists` on the next request rather than as an error on this one.

  The published [FIX dictionary](https://assets.kalshi.com/fix/kalshi-fix-dictionary.xml)
  lists `55` first, since a dictionary can only declare one delimiter per group. MVE
  requests legitimately omit `55`, so a strict dictionary-driven validator may flag them —
  relax the delimiter for the MVE case rather than adding an empty `55`.
</Note>

<Info>
  **MVE/Parlay Support**: Instead of specifying a Symbol, you can submit MVE legs directly. The server will automatically resolve or create the parlay market and return the resolved market ticker in the QuoteRequestAck.

### Exchange → Market Maker (RFQ Notification)

The exchange builds this message with the same structure market makers must parse:
`55`, `38`, `152` and the nested `453=NoPartyIDs` group are members of the
`146=NoRelatedSym` group, and the MVE tags sit in the message body.

<Info>
  When creating an RFQ with MVE legs instead of a Symbol, the resolved market ticker is returned in tag 55. This is the market that was created or looked up based on your leg selection.

# Subpenny Pricing
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/fix/subpenny-pricing

Dollar-based pricing format for subpenny precision

For the general overview of fixed-point pricing and contract quantities across REST and WebSocket APIs, see [Fixed-Point Representation](/getting_started/fixed_point_migration).

## Technical Specification

To enable subpenny precision, include tag **21005** in your Logon message:

| Tag   | Name       | Description                      | Value |
| ----- | ---------- | -------------------------------- | ----- |
| 21005 | UseDollars | Enable dollar-based price format | Y     |

Overview:

* **Legacy Format (Cents)**: Prices given in whole cents. E.g. 72 cents = `72`.
* **New Format (Dollars)**: Prices normalized to dollars with fixed precision (up to 4 decimal places).

Examples:

| Cents | FIX Decimal       | String Representation |
| ----- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 1.23¢ | Decimal(123, -4)  | 0.0123                |
| 72.5¢ | Decimal(7250, -4) | 0.725                 |
| 99¢   | Decimal(9900, -4) | 0.99                  |

Affected Tags:

| Tag | Field Name | Description            |
| --- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| 6   | AvgPx      | Average price of fills |
| 31  | LastPx     | Price of last fill     |
| 44  | Price      | Order limit price      |
| 132 | BidPx      | Quote bid price        |
| 133 | OfferPx    | Quote ask price        |

# API Environments and Endpoints
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/api_environments

REST and WebSocket base URLs for production and demo

Kalshi provides separate production and demo environments. Credentials are not shared between environments, so demo API keys only work against demo endpoints and production API keys only work against production endpoints.

## REST API

Use these base URLs for the Trade API:

| Environment | Recommended base URL                               | Also supported                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Production  | `https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2`     | `https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2` |

The `external-api` hosts are dedicated to the external Trade API and are the recommended hosts for API traders. The existing shared hosts remain supported for compatibility with existing clients.

<Note>
  Despite the `elections` subdomain, the production Trade API provides access to all Kalshi markets, not only election-related markets.
</Note>

## WebSocket API

Use these WebSocket URLs for the Trade API:

| Environment | Recommended URL                                        | Also supported                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Production  | `wss://external-api-ws.kalshi.com/trade-api/ws/v2`     | `wss://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/ws/v2` |
| Demo        | `wss://external-api-ws.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2` | `wss://demo-api.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2`       |

## Private Connectivity

For participants requiring network-level isolation, Kalshi supports private connectivity to the REST and WebSocket APIs via [AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/what-is-privatelink.html). With PrivateLink, your API traffic is routed entirely within the AWS backbone and never traverses the public internet.

PrivateLink is available for the production hosts `external-api.kalshi.com` (REST) and `external-api-ws.kalshi.com` (WebSocket). The two APIs are provisioned as separate interface endpoints, each reachable over TLS on port 443. Connect to the endpoint's DNS name from within your VPC and set the matching host above as the TLS server name (SNI).

Members on the Premier tier or above can contact [institutional@kalshi.com](mailto:institutional@kalshi.com) to provision PrivateLink endpoints for their AWS account.

## Request Signing

The host does not change the signature payload. Sign the full request path from the API root, without query parameters.

For example, all of these hosts use the same signed path for an order request:

```text theme={null}
/trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders
```

If the request URL is:

```text theme={null}
https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders?limit=5
```

sign:

```text theme={null}
/trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders
```

not the hostname and not the query string.


# API Keys
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/api_keys

API Key usage

<Info>
  This process is the same for the demo or production environment.
</Info>

## Generating an API Key

### Access the Account Settings Page:

Log in to your account and navigate to the "Account Settings" page. You can typically find this option by clicking on your profile picture or account icon in the top-right corner of the application.

### Generate a New API Key

In the "Profile Settings" page [https://kalshi.com/account/profile](https://kalshi.com/account/profile), locate the "API Keys" section. Click on the "Create New API Key" button. This action will generate a new API key in the RSA\_PRIVATE\_KEY format.

### Store Your API Key and Key ID:

After generating the key, you will be presented with:
• Private Key: This is your secret key in RSA\_PRIVATE\_KEY format.
• Key ID: This is a unique identifier associated with your private key.

**Important**: For security reasons, the private key will not be stored by our service, and you will not be able to retrieve it again once this page is closed. Please make sure to securely copy and save the private key immediately. The key will also be downloaded as txt file with the name provided.

## Using a API Key

Each request to Kalshi trading api will need to be signed with the private key generated above.

The following header values will need to be provided with each request:

`KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY`- the Key ID

`KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP` - the request timestamp in ms

`KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE`- request hash signed with private key

The above signature is generated by signing a concatenation of the timestamp, the HTTP method and the path.

<Warning>
  **Important**: When signing requests, use the path **without query parameters**. For example, if your request is to `/trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders?limit=5`, sign only `/trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders` (strip the `?` and everything after it).
</Warning>

Sample code for generating the required headers is below. For end-to-end examples, see [Quick Start: Authenticated Requests](/getting_started/quick_start_authenticated_requests).

### Python

Load the private key stored in a file

```python theme={null}
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

def load_private_key_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "rb") as key_file:
        private_key = serialization.load_pem_private_key(
            key_file.read(),
            password=None,  # or provide a password if your key is encrypted
            backend=default_backend()
        )
    return private_key
```

Sign text with private key

```python theme={null}
import base64
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding, rsa
from cryptography.exceptions import InvalidSignature

def sign_pss_text(private_key: rsa.RSAPrivateKey, text: str) -> str:
    message = text.encode('utf-8')
    try:
        signature = private_key.sign(
            message,
            padding.PSS(
                mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
                salt_length=padding.PSS.DIGEST_LENGTH
            ),
            hashes.SHA256()
        )
        return base64.b64encode(signature).decode('utf-8')
    except InvalidSignature as e:
        raise ValueError("RSA sign PSS failed") from e
```

Send a request to Kalshi API with signed header

```python theme={null}
import requests
import datetime

current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
timestamp = current_time.timestamp()
current_time_milliseconds = int(timestamp * 1000)
timestampt_str = str(current_time_milliseconds)

private_key = load_private_key_from_file('kalshi-key-2.key')

method = "GET"
base_url = 'https://external-api.demo.kalshi.co'
path='/trade-api/v2/portfolio/balance'

# Strip query parameters from path before signing
path_without_query = path.split('?')[0]
msg_string = timestampt_str + method + path_without_query
sig = sign_pss_text(private_key, msg_string)

headers = {
    'KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY': 'a952bcbe-ec3b-4b5b-b8f9-11dae589608c',
    'KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE': sig,
    'KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP': timestampt_str
}

response = requests.get(base_url + path, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

### Javascript

Load the private key stored in a file

```javascript theme={null}
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function loadPrivateKeyFromFile(filePath) {
    const absolutePath = path.resolve(filePath);
    const privateKeyPem = fs.readFileSync(absolutePath, 'utf8');
    return privateKeyPem;
}
```

Sign text with private key

```javascript theme={null}
const crypto = require('crypto');

function signPssText(privateKeyPem, text) {
    const sign = crypto.createSign('RSA-SHA256');
    sign.update(text);
    sign.end();

    const signature = sign.sign({
        key: privateKeyPem,
        padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_PSS_PADDING,
        saltLength: crypto.constants.RSA_PSS_SALTLEN_DIGEST,
    });

    return signature.toString('base64');
}
```

Send a request to Kalshi API with signed header

```javascript theme={null}
const axios = require('axios');

const currentTimeMilliseconds = Date.now();
const timestampStr = currentTimeMilliseconds.toString();

const privateKeyPem = loadPrivateKeyFromFile('path/to/your/private-key.pem');

const method = "GET";
const baseUrl = 'https://external-api.demo.kalshi.co';
const path = '/trade-api/v2/portfolio/balance';

// Strip query parameters from path before signing
const pathWithoutQuery = path.split('?')[0];
const msgString = timestampStr + method + pathWithoutQuery;
const sig = signPssText(privateKeyPem, msgString);

const headers = {
    'KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY': 'your-api-key-id',
    'KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE': sig,
    'KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP': timestampStr
};

axios.get(baseUrl + path, { headers })
    .then(response => {
        console.log(response.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    });
```

# Exchange Sharding
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/exchange_sharding

Exchange sharding in the Predictions API

## Overview

In order to scale capacity, Kalshi will be splitting trading across multiple matching engines.
Exchange instances will correspond to a specific category (e.g. "crypto" exchange, a "combos" exchange).
Kalshi plans to add shards incrementally to maintain a healthy balance of traffic.

## Timeline

Kalshi will migrate combos from the "default" exchange instance to shard 1, followed by crypto and selected sports series.

* August 6, 2026: intra-exchange instance transfers enabled to exchange index 1.
* August 10, 2026: `KXMVECROSSCATEGORY-SHARD1-R` multivariate event collection created with support for all combos.
* August 17, 2026: combos created over legacy collections `KXMVESPORTSMULTIGAMEEXTENDED-R`, `KXMVECROSSCATEGORY-R` will be created on shard 1.
* August 24, 2026: new crypto events will be created on shard 2, and new tennis and baseball events will be created on shard 3.

## Balance Management

Kalshi's collateralization checks will continue to run within the matching engine. Programmatic traders must preallocate collateral on a given exchange shard before order placement.

**Funding Overview**

* Account transfers can be made through the [Intra Account Transfer API](/api-reference/portfolio/intra-account-transfer).
* Manual transfers are also available through the [Kalshi UI](https://kalshi.com/account/exchange-indexes).
* [Get Balance](/api-reference/portfolio/get-balance) provides a breakdown of account balances across exchange indexes.

**Subaccounts Overview**

* To fund a subaccount on a new exchange instance, first transfer user-level funds to the desired exchange instance.
* Next, use [Create Subaccount](/api-reference/portfolio/create-subaccount) with the `exchange_index` parameter to provision the subaccount on the new instance.
* Then, use [Transfer Between Subaccounts](/api-reference/portfolio/transfer-between-subaccounts) with the `exchange_index` parameter to transfer funds from the primary account to the subaccount on that instance.
* [Get All Subaccount Balances](/api-reference/portfolio/get-all-subaccount-balances) provides a breakdown of subaccount balances for each `(exchange_index, subaccount)` pair.

## Order routing

### Market Data

* A new field `exchange_index` is provided on [`GET /markets`](/api-reference/market/get-markets), [`GET /events`](/api-reference/events/get-events), and via the [market and event lifecycle WebSocket streams](/websockets/market-and-event-lifecycle) for newly created events and markets.
* Market ticker formats are unaffected by exchange sharding. The `exchange_index` field is the authoritative source of truth.

### REST

The `exchange_index` parameter is available on a per-endpoint basis.

* If omitted: defaults to `0`.
* Else if `-1`: routes to the target exchange for the provided market ticker.
* Else if `>= 0`: routes directly to the target exchange.

### FIX

The [`ExDestination` parameter](/fix/order-entry) (FIX Tag 100) is available on a per-message basis.

* If omitted: defaults to `0`.
* Else if `-1`: routes to the target exchange for the provided `Symbol` (FIX Tag 55).
* Else if `>= 0`: routes directly to the target exchange.

## Upcoming Series Shard Assignments

The following assignments determine the shard where new events will be created. Shard 0 is the catch-all for all categories and tags not listed below.

| Shard index | Category               | Tags             | Series list                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## FAQ

* All child markets of an event will live on the same exchange instance.
* There is currently no plan to migrate any live market to a new exchange instance.
* Providing `ExDestination` / `exchange_index` is unnecessary for all RFQ operations, including FIX [`QuoteRequest` (`35=R`), `Quote` (`35=S`), and `AcceptQuote` (`35=UA`)](/fix/rfq-messages), which are routed internally by Kalshi.
* Automatic routing will incur an additional latency cost.
* Subaccount balances are local to a specific exchange instance.
* Order groups do not function across exchange instances.
* [`KXMVECROSSCATEGORY-SHARD1-R`](https://demo-api.kalshi.co/trade-api/v2/multivariate_event_collections/KXMVECROSSCATEGORY-SHARD1-R) is live in demo for testing.


# Fee Rounding
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/fee_rounding

How the exchange rounds fees to maintain balance precision.

## Overview

User balances have a target precision before and after every fill:

* Direct member balances are rounded to the nearest `$0.0001` (`0.01c`)
* Non-direct member balances are rounded to the nearest `$0.01` (`1c`)

When a trade produces a balance change that is more precise than the user's target balance precision, the exchange charges a **rounding fee** to bring the balance back to that target. The **fee accumulator** still applies across all fills of an order so that the total fee converges to what a single equivalent fill would cost.

Every fill produces three fee components:

| Component        | Description                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trade fee**    | Fee from the fee model, rounded up to the nearest \$0.0001 (centicent)     |
| **Rounding fee** | Adjustment that restores the user's target balance precision               |
| **Rebate**       | Refund from accumulated rounding overpayment (always a multiple of \$0.01) |

**Net fee** = trade fee + rounding fee - rebate (always >= \$0.00)

## Rounding Mechanics

Given a fill's `revenue` (signed; negative for buyers) and `trade_fee`:

1. Round trade fee **up** to the nearest \$0.0001
2. Compute `balance_change = revenue - trade_fee`
3. Floor `balance_change` toward negative infinity to the user's target balance precision
4. `rounding_fee = balance_change - floor(balance_change)`

The user's balance changes by `floor(balance_change)`, which is always aligned to the user's target balance precision.

## Fee Accumulator

The fee accumulator tracks cumulative rounding overpayment across all fills of an order. Once the accumulated rounding exceeds \$0.01, a whole-cent rebate is issued and the accumulator is reduced by \$0.01. This ensures the total fee across many small fills converges to what a single equivalent fill would cost.

<Note>
  The fee accumulator is maintained per order across all fills regardless of whether the fills are taker or maker. If an order initially takes (matching resting orders) and then becomes a resting maker order, the accumulated rounding carries over to subsequent maker fills.
</Note>

## Worked Examples

The examples below assume a target balance precision of `$0.01` (`1c`). For direct members of the exchange, apply the same mechanics with `$0.0001` (`0.01c`) as the target precision.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Subpenny prices: buy 3 contracts at $0.055 (three 1-lot matches)">
    Buy **3 contracts** at **\$0.055**, filled as three 1-lot matches. Contracts are whole; rounding arises from the sub-cent price.

    **Fill 1 walkthrough:**

    ```
    revenue        = -$0.055 x 1       = -$0.0550
    trade fee      = $0.0085             (ceiled to centicent)
    balance change = -$0.0550 - $0.0085  = -$0.0635
                     floored to            -$0.07
    rounding fee   = $0.07 - $0.0635    =  $0.0065
    ```

    **All fills:**

    | Fill | Trade Fee | Rounding | Accumulator |   Rebate |  Net Fee | Balance Change |
    | ---: | --------: | -------: | ----------: | -------: | -------: | -------------: |
    |    1 |  \$0.0085 | \$0.0065 |    \$0.0065 |        — | \$0.0150 |        -\$0.07 |
    |    2 |  \$0.0085 | \$0.0065 |    \$0.0130 | \$0.0100 | \$0.0050 |        -\$0.07 |
    |    3 |  \$0.0085 | \$0.0065 |    \$0.0095 |        — | \$0.0150 |        -\$0.07 |

    On Fill 2, the accumulator reaches \$0.0130 (> \$0.01), triggering a \$0.01 rebate. The net fee drops to \$0.0050 for that fill.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fractional contracts: buy 0.90 contracts at $0.50 (three 0.30-lot matches)">
    Buy **0.90 contracts** at **\$0.50**, filled as three 0.30-lot matches. The price is a whole cent; rounding arises from the fractional quantity.

    **Fill 1 walkthrough:**

    ```
    revenue        = -$0.50 x 0.30       = -$0.1500
    trade fee      = $0.0041               (ceiled to centicent)
    balance change = -$0.1500 - $0.0041    = -$0.1541
                     floored to              -$0.16
    rounding fee   = $0.16 - $0.1541      =  $0.0059
    ```

    **All fills:**

    | Fill | Trade Fee | Rounding | Accumulator |   Rebate |  Net Fee | Balance Change |
    | ---: | --------: | -------: | ----------: | -------: | -------: | -------------: |
    |    1 |  \$0.0041 | \$0.0059 |    \$0.0059 |        — | \$0.0100 |        -\$0.16 |
    |    2 |  \$0.0041 | \$0.0059 |    \$0.0118 | \$0.0100 | \$0.0000 |        -\$0.16 |
    |    3 |  \$0.0041 | \$0.0059 |    \$0.0077 |        — | \$0.0100 |        -\$0.16 |

    On Fill 2, the accumulator reaches \$0.0118 (> \$0.01), triggering a \$0.01 rebate. The entire fee is offset, resulting in a \$0.00 net fee for that fill.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Combined: fractional contracts + subpenny prices (three 0.03-lot matches)">
    Buy **0.09 contracts** at **\$0.3301**, filled as three 0.03-lot matches. Both features contribute sub-cent components, pushing intermediates to 6 decimal places.

    **Fill 1 walkthrough:**

    ```
    revenue        = -$0.3301 x 0.03      = -$0.009903
    trade fee      = $0.0005                (ceiled to centicent)
    balance change = -$0.009903 - $0.0005  = -$0.010403
                     floored to              -$0.02
    rounding fee   = $0.02 - $0.010403     =  $0.009597
    ```

    **All fills:**

    | Fill | Trade Fee |   Rounding | Accumulator |   Rebate |    Net Fee | Balance Change |
    | ---: | --------: | ---------: | ----------: | -------: | ---------: | -------------: |
    |    1 |  \$0.0005 | \$0.009597 |  \$0.009597 |        — | \$0.010097 |        -\$0.02 |
    |    2 |  \$0.0005 | \$0.009597 |  \$0.019194 | \$0.0100 | \$0.000097 |        -\$0.02 |
    |    3 |  \$0.0005 | \$0.009597 |  \$0.018791 | \$0.0100 | \$0.000097 |        -\$0.02 |

    The accumulator triggers a rebate on both Fill 2 and Fill 3, keeping the total net fee close to the single-fill equivalent.

    <Note>
      Subpenny prices alone produce 4-decimal-place intermediates. Fractional contracts alone also produce 4-decimal-place intermediates. When combined, intermediates can reach 6 decimal places (e.g., \$0.3301 x 0.03 = \$0.009903). Final balances are rounded to the user's target balance precision.

# Fixed-Point Representation
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/fixed_point_migration

Fixed-point prices, price level structures, and fractional contract quantities.

Last Updated: August 20, 2026

## Overview

Kalshi APIs represent prices and contract quantities as fixed-point strings:

1. **Prices**: fixed-point dollar strings (`_dollars` suffix), up to 4 decimal places
2. **Contract quantities**: fixed-point strings (`_fp` suffix), up to 2 decimal places

***

## Prices

Prices are represented as fixed-point dollar strings.

```json theme={null}
{
    "price_dollars": "0.1200"
}
```

* `*_dollars` fields are fixed-point dollar strings with up to 4 decimal places (e.g., `"0.1200"`)
* Integer-cent fields cannot represent sub-cent prices; on markets with sub-cent ticks, read prices from the `*_dollars` fields
* When combined with fractional contract sizes, intermediate calculations can reach up to 6 decimal places (for example, in fee rounding math)

### Price Level Structures

Each market's valid prices form a fixed grid, described by two fields on Market responses:

* `price_ranges` — an array of `{ start, end, step }` bands in fixed-point dollars. This is the source of truth for valid prices: any price on the grid is valid, and any off-grid price is rejected. Consume it dynamically per market and snap order and quote prices to the relevant band's `step`.
* `price_level_structure` — a human-readable label for the grid. Do not key pricing logic off this name; new structures are introduced over time, and a client that reads `price_ranges` is automatically compatible with all of them.

| Structure                      | Ranges          | Tick Size |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | --------- |
| `linear_cent`                  | \$0.00 – \$1.00 | \$0.01    |
| `deci_cent`                    | \$0.00 – \$1.00 | \$0.001   |
| `tapered_deci_cent`            | \$0.00 – \$0.10 | \$0.001   |
|                                | \$0.10 – \$0.90 | \$0.01    |
|                                | \$0.90 – \$1.00 | \$0.001   |
| `center_whole_edge_half_cent`  | \$0.00 – \$0.10 | \$0.005   |
|                                | \$0.10 – \$0.90 | \$0.01    |
|                                | \$0.90 – \$1.00 | \$0.005   |
| `center_whole_edge_quint_cent` | \$0.00 – \$0.10 | \$0.002   |
|                                | \$0.10 – \$0.90 | \$0.01    |
|                                | \$0.90 – \$1.00 | \$0.002   |
| `center_half_edge_half_cent`   | \$0.00 – \$1.00 | \$0.005   |
| `center_half_edge_quint_cent`  | \$0.00 – \$0.10 | \$0.002   |
|                                | \$0.10 – \$0.90 | \$0.005   |
|                                | \$0.90 – \$1.00 | \$0.002   |
| `center_half_edge_deci_cent`   | \$0.00 – \$0.10 | \$0.001   |
|                                | \$0.10 – \$0.90 | \$0.005   |
|                                | \$0.90 – \$1.00 | \$0.001   |
| `center_quint_edge_quint_cent` | \$0.00 – \$1.00 | \$0.002   |
| `center_quint_edge_deci_cent`  | \$0.00 – \$0.10 | \$0.001   |
|                                | \$0.10 – \$0.90 | \$0.002   |
|                                | \$0.90 – \$1.00 | \$0.001   |
| `center_centi_edge_centi_cent` | \$0.00 – \$1.00 | \$0.0001  |
| `center_deci_edge_centi_cent`  | \$0.00 – \$0.01 | \$0.0001  |
|                                | \$0.01 – \$0.99 | \$0.001   |
|                                | \$0.99 – \$1.00 | \$0.0001  |

Newer structures follow the naming convention `center_{center}_edge_{edge}_cent`, where the shorthands are `whole` = \$0.01, `half` = \$0.005, `quint` = \$0.002, `deci` = \$0.001, and `centi` = \$0.0001. Tapered structures apply the finer edge tick near the boundaries of the price range — where small absolute price differences represent large relative changes in implied probability — and the center tick in between; most taper below \$0.10 and above \$0.90, while `center_deci_edge_centi_cent` tapers below \$0.01 and above \$0.99. When the center and edge ticks are equal, the grid is uniform. The older names (`linear_cent`, `tapered_deci_cent`, `deci_cent`) predate this convention.

Whole-cent prices are valid in every structure. Structures are assigned per market — for example, multivariate (combo) markets use `center_centi_edge_centi_cent`. When a market's structure changes, the `price_level_structure_updated` event on the market lifecycle WebSocket channels carries the new `price_ranges`.

## Fractional Contracts

Contract count fields use fixed-point strings and support fractional contract sizes.

```json theme={null}
{
  "count_fp": "10.00"
}
```

* `*_fp` fields are strings
* Accept 0-2 decimal places on input (responses always emit 2 decimals)
* Minimum granularity is 0.01 contracts
* In requests where both integer and `_fp` fields are provided, they must match

Even if you are not placing fractional orders, you will encounter fractional values elsewhere in the API (for example, fills). If your system uses integer arithmetic, one approach is to internally multiply the `_fp` value by 100 and cast to an integer — treating `"1.55"` as 155 units of 1c contracts.

***

## Fee Rounding

Both sub-cent pricing and fractional contracts can produce balance changes with more precision than a user's balance alignment. When this happens, the exchange applies a rounding fee to restore the applicable balance precision, and a fee accumulator issues rebates to prevent systematic overpayment.

See [Fee Rounding](/getting_started/fee_rounding) for the mechanics and worked examples.


# Historical Data
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/historical_data

Accessing historical exchange data via the Kalshi API.

## Overview

As trading activity on Kalshi grows, so does the volume of settled markets, completed trades, and fulfilled orders. To keep the live API fast and responsive, Kalshi partitions exchange data into **live** and **historical** tiers.

Live endpoints return current and recent data: open and recently closed markets, active orders, and recent fills. Older data that is no longer actively referenced is made available through a separate set of historical endpoints.

This separation means that if you query for data that is older than the cutoff (described below), you'll need to use the historical API instead of the standard live endpoints. The partitioning happens for **markets**, **market\_candlesticks**,
**trades**, **orders**, and **market\_positions**. Old **Events** and **Series** will always still be available through their original endpoints.

## How It Works

The boundary between live and historical data is defined by a set of **cutoff timestamps**, which you can retrieve at any time via `GET /historical/cutoff`. Any record older than the relevant cutoff must be queried through the corresponding historical endpoint.

The cutoff timestamps will be regularly updated, advancing forward over time. The target window for live data is **3 months**.

## Cutoff Timestamps

| Field                              | Partitioned By                       | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `market_settled_ts`                | Market settlement time               | Markets and their candlesticks that settled before this timestamp are only available via `GET /historical/markets`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `trades_created_ts`                | Trade fill time                      | Trades that occurred before this timestamp are only available via `GET /historical/trades`. User fills are only available via `GET /historical/fills`                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `orders_updated_ts`                | Order cancellation or execution time | Orders canceled or fully executed before this timestamp are only available via `GET /historical/orders`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `market_positions_last_updated_ts` | Position last-update time            | Settled positions archived from the live data set before this timestamp are only available via `GET /historical/positions`. Positions are archived per whole event: an event's positions all remain live until every market in the event has settled, regardless of how old the oldest settled market is, and are never split across the two endpoints |

<Note>
  Resting (active) orders are unaffected and always appear in `GET /portfolio/orders`, regardless of the cutoff. Likewise, unsettled positions always appear in `GET /portfolio/positions`.
</Note>

## Historical Endpoints

| Endpoint                                        | Description                                                   |

| `GET /historical/trades`                        | All trades older than the cutoff                              |
| `GET /historical/fills`                         | User-scoped trade fills older than the cutoff                 |

| `GET /historical/positions`                     | User-scoped settled positions archived from the live data set |

## Impacted Live Endpoints

The following live endpoints will no longer return data older than the corresponding cutoff:

| Live Endpoint                                 | Cutoff Field                       | Impact                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET /markets`, `GET /markets/{ticker}`       | `market_settled_ts`                | Settled markets and their candlesticks older than the cutoff will not appear                           |
| `GET /events` with `with_nested_markets=true` | `market_settled_ts`                | Nested markets older than the cutoff will not be included, only markets impacted                       |
| `GET /markets/trades`                         | `trades_created_ts`                | Trades older than the cutoff will not appear                                                           |
| `GET /portfolio/fills`                        | `trades_created_ts`                | Fills older than the cutoff will not appear                                                            |
| `GET /portfolio/orders`                       | `orders_updated_ts`                | Completed/canceled orders older than the cutoff will not appear (resting orders are unaffected)        |
| `GET /portfolio/positions`                    | `market_positions_last_updated_ts` | Settled positions archived from the live data set will not appear (unsettled positions are unaffected) |

## Migration Guide

1. **Fetch the cutoff**: call `GET /historical/cutoff` to get the current timestamps.
2. **Route queries accordingly**: if the data you need is older than the relevant cutoff, use the corresponding `GET /historical/...` endpoint instead.
3. **Combine results if needed**: for use cases like building a complete fill history, query both the live and historical endpoints and merge the results.

<Info>
  The historical endpoints support the same [cursor-based pagination](/getting_started/pagination) as their live counterparts.

# Maintenance and Pauses
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/maintenance_and_pauses

Scheduled maintenance windows, trading pauses, and exchange pauses

## Scheduled Maintenance

Every **Thursday from 3:00 AM to 5:00 AM ET**, Kalshi runs scheduled maintenance. During this window, a **trading pause** is in effect. In rare cases, a more intensive maintenance may require a full **exchange pause** instead.

Clients should be prepared for session disconnections during this window and reconnect after 5:00 AM ET.

## Trading Pause vs Exchange Pause

|                          | Trading Pause                                         | Exchange Pause                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **When**                 | Every Thursday 3:00–5:00 AM ET                        | Rare; during scheduled maintenance if intensive work is needed, or unscheduled if Kalshi has a temporary outage |
| **Place / amend orders** | No                                                    | No                                                                                                              |
| **Cancel orders**        | Yes                                                   | No                                                                                                              |
| **Resting orders**       | Remain on the book (unless CancelOrderOnPause is set) | Remain on the book (unless CancelOrderOnPause is set)                                                           |

If an exchange pause occurs outside the scheduled Thursday window, it indicates a temporary Kalshi Exchange outage.

## CancelOrderOnPause

When placing an order, you can set `CancelOrderOnPause` to control whether the order is automatically cancelled during either type of pause.

| Value               | Behavior                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| true / Y            | Order is automatically cancelled when a trading or exchange pause begins |
| false / N (default) | Order remains resting on the book and resumes when activity reopens      |

Set this field on order creation:

* **REST**: `cancel_order_on_pause` field on the create order request
* **FIX**: Tag `21006` (CancelOrderOnPause) on New Order Single (35=D) messages

To make your request we recommend testing a public endpoint like [GetMarkets](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/market/get-markets). As you explore our other endpoints, you'll notice some endpoints return an authentication\_error. If you want to experiment with these endpoints, you will need to get [API Keys](https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/api_keys). You may also want to sign up for a demo account to test without real funds.

# Market Lifecycle
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/market_lifecycle

How markets move from creation to settlement

Markets on Kalshi follow a lifecycle from creation through trading to determination and settlement. This page describes the states a market passes through and what to expect at each stage.

## Statuses

The REST API returns these statuses on `GET /markets` and `GET /markets/{ticker}`:

| Status        | Meaning                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `initialized` | Created but not yet open for trading. Transitions to `active` when `open_time` passes.    |
| `active`      | Open for trading.                                                                         |
| `inactive`    | Temporarily deactivated by the exchange. Trading is paused but the market has not closed. |
| `closed`      | Past `close_time`. No new orders accepted. Awaiting determination.                        |
| `determined`  | Result is known. Settlement timer is running.                                             |
| `disputed`    | Result has been challenged. May be re-determined.                                         |
| `amended`     | Re-determined after a dispute. Settlement timer restarts.                                 |
| `finalized`   | Settlement complete. Positions have been paid out. Terminal state.                        |

When filtering with `GET /markets?status=`, the values map as follows:

| Filter value | Matches                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `unopened`   | `initialized` (before `open_time`)                       |
| `open`       | `active`                                                 |
| `paused`     | `inactive`                                               |
| `closed`     | Any market past `close_time` that is not yet `finalized` |
| `settled`    | `finalized`                                              |

## Transitions

Some transitions are implicit (time-based), others are explicit (event-driven).

**Implicit (no WebSocket event):**

* `initialized` → `active`: when `open_time` passes. There is no `activated` WebSocket event for this transition.
* `active` / `inactive` → `closed`: when `close_time` passes.

**Explicit (WebSocket event emitted):**

* `active` → `inactive`: exchange deactivates the market. Event: `deactivated`.
* `inactive` → `active`: exchange reactivates a paused market. Event: `activated`. All resting orders are cancelled on this reactivation.
* `closed` → reopened `active`: `close_time` is moved into the future. Events: `close_date_updated`, then `activated`.
* Close time updated: `close_time` changes. Event: `close_date_updated`. This can happen when a market is closed ahead of its scheduled close time, including before determination.
* `closed` → `determined`: result is set. Event: `determined`.
* `determined` / `amended` → `finalized`: positions paid out. Event: `settled`.

## Time fields

Markets have several time fields:

| `expiration_time`          | Deprecated legacy field. Prefer `latest_expiration_time` for the legacy expiry semantics; use `expected_expiration_time` if you want the forecasted time. |

## Determination and settlement

After a market closes and the outcome is known, the market is determined and `result` is set to `yes`, `no`, or `scalar`.

A settlement timer then runs for `settlement_timer_seconds`, which is visible in the REST response. During this window the market remains at `determined` and the result may be disputed.

Once settlement completes, positions are paid out. In REST, settled markets end up at `finalized` rather than a separate `settled` status, and `settlement_ts` is populated.

## Orders after close

Once `close_time` passes, all order operations, including cancellations, are rejected with `MARKET_INACTIVE`. Resting orders are cancelled shortly after close, and cancellation updates are published on the usual user channels.

## WebSocket

Market lifecycle events are delivered on two channels:

| Channel                         | Markets covered                   | Event types                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `market_lifecycle_v2`           | All markets except MVE (`KXMVE*`) | `created`, `activated`, `deactivated`, `close_date_updated`, `determined`, `settled`, `metadata_updated` |
| `multivariate_market_lifecycle` | MVE markets only (`KXMVE*`)       | `created`, `activated`, `deactivated`, `close_date_updated`, `determined`, `settled`                     |

Both channels also emit `event_lifecycle` messages when new events are created.

The `market_lifecycle_v2` channel additionally emits `event_fee_update` messages when an event-level fee override is set or cleared.

The WebSocket `settled` event corresponds to settlement being processed; in REST, settled markets end up at `finalized`.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can `expected_expiration_time` be before `close_time`?">
    `expected_expiration_time` is the time the event is likely to resolve (for a sports game, typically a few hours after the scheduled start). `close_time` is when the market automatically closes for trading, and may be set well into the future to allow for rescheduling. That means `expected_expiration_time` can be earlier than `close_time`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why might `GET /markets/{ticker}` return `404` right after a `created` event?">
    The market may not be queryable immediately after a `created` event. Retry with backoff.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do event responses include a top-level `status` field?">
    `GET /events` supports a `status` filter with values `unopened`, `open`, `closed`, and `settled`. The filter matches on child market statuses, not an event-level status; an event appears in results if **any** of its child markets has a matching status. For example, an event with four open markets and one settled market matches both `status=open` and `status=settled`. Use `with_nested_markets=true` if you need individual market statuses.

# Market Settlement
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/market_settlement

How market outcomes are determined and positions are resolved

Settlement occurs when a market's outcome is determined. Positions are automatically resolved and funds transferred.

## How It Works

* **Yes outcome**: Yes contract holders receive \$1 per contract
* **No outcome**: No contract holders receive \$1 per contract
* Only net positions are settled (after netting)

## Settlement Timing

Markets typically settle shortly after expiration, but timing can vary based on market type, data source availability, and manual review requirements.

## Fees

Settlement fees are zero for simple yes/no determinations but may apply for sub-cent scalar settlement. The actual payout (`CollateralAmountChange`) is rounded to whole cents. `CollateralAmountChange + MiscFeeAmt` equals the pre-rounding settlement value.

# Order direction (outcome_side and book_side)
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/order_direction

How direction is expressed on Order, Fill, and Trade responses, and how to migrate from the legacy action/side fields.

Direction on every Order, Fill, and Trade response is expressed by two
fields that carry the same bit in two vocabularies:

* **`outcome_side`** (`yes` | `no`): which outcome the user is positioned
  for. A user paying to be long the yes outcome has `outcome_side=yes`;
  paying to be long the no outcome has `outcome_side=no`.
* **`book_side`** (`bid` | `ask`): same bit in book-vocabulary.
  **`bid ≡ yes`, `ask ≡ no`**, always.

Pick whichever vocabulary fits your integration; you only need one of
them to know the trade's direction.

On public `Trade` and the `trade` WebSocket channel the fields are
named `taker_outcome_side` and `taker_book_side`, since a public trade
has no user perspective and reports the taker's side.

## Direction does not change the price

`outcome_side` describes directional exposure only; it does not change
the order's price. An order at price `p` with `outcome_side=no` is
matched by an order at the same price `p` with `outcome_side=yes`:
both parties trade at the same price, just on opposite directions.

## Equivalence between (action, side) and outcome\_side

Buy-yes and sell-no produce the same directional exposure (long yes);
buy-no and sell-yes both produce long no. The new fields make this
collapse explicit:

| Legacy `action` | Legacy `side` | `outcome_side` | `book_side` |
| --------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| buy             | yes           | yes            | bid         |
| sell            | no            | yes            | bid         |
| buy             | no            | no             | ask         |
| sell            | yes           | no             | ask         |

## Migration

`outcome_side` and `book_side` are the canonical way to determine
direction going forward. The legacy fields below are marked
deprecated and **will not be removed before May 28, 2026**.

| Legacy field     | Surface           | Replacement                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `action`         | Order, Fill       | `outcome_side` / `book_side`             |
| `side`           | Order, Fill       | `outcome_side` / `book_side`             |
| `is_yes`         | Order (WS)        | `outcome_side` / `book_side`             |
| `purchased_side` | Fill (WS)         | `outcome_side` / `book_side`             |
| `taker_side`     | Trade (REST + WS) | `taker_outcome_side` / `taker_book_side` |

Existing integrations continue to receive the legacy fields until the
removal date. New integrations should read only `outcome_side` and
`book_side` (or the `taker_*` variants on public trades).

## Orderbook pricing convention

The `orderbook_delta` and `orderbook_snapshot` WebSocket channels are an
exception to the price-doesn't-change rule above. By default, no-side
deltas and snapshot levels are reported in **no-leg pricing**: a no-side
delta at `price_dollars=0.30` corresponds to a market offer of "no at
30c", which would match against "yes at 70c". The yes-side and no-side
therefore use different price scales by default: toggling sides flips
the price.

Subscriptions can opt into a single-scale view by passing
`use_yes_price: true` in the subscribe command params. When set:

* Yes-side deltas and snapshot levels are unchanged.
* No-side deltas and snapshot levels are reported in **yes-leg
  pricing** instead of no-leg, so `price_dollars` carries the same
  scale on both sides. A no-side delta at the price level that would
  otherwise be reported as `0.30` (no-leg) is instead reported as
  `0.70` (yes-leg).

This brings the orderbook channels in line with the price-doesn't-change
semantics on Order/Fill/Trade. The flag defaults to false to preserve
the existing long-standing behavior; new integrations are encouraged to
set it.

**Migration plan.** The default for `use_yes_price` will be flipped to
`true` in a future release, so subscriptions that don't explicitly set
it will start receiving the unified yes-leg pricing automatically. The
flag itself will then be removed in a subsequent release and the
unified-pricing behavior will be the only supported behavior; explicit
`use_yes_price: false` requests will no longer toggle the legacy
no-leg pricing once the flag is removed. We will announce concrete
dates for both steps before they happen; integrations that depend on
the legacy no-leg pricing should plan to migrate before the default
flip.


# Order Groups
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/order_groups

Automatic order cancellation based on rolling contract limits

Order groups provide automatic order cancellation when a contracts limit is reached within a rolling 15-second window. When an order group is triggered, all resting orders in that group are canceled and no new orders can be placed until the group is reset.

## How It Works

1. **Create** a group with a contracts limit (1–1,000,000). The server generates the group ID and returns it in the response.
2. **Place orders** with the group's ID. Each order is tracked against the group.
3. **As orders execute**, filled contract counts accumulate within a rolling 15-second window.
4. **If the rolling total exceeds the limit**, the group is triggered: all resting orders in the group are canceled.

## Group States

| State         | Behavior                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active**    | Orders can be placed; rolling volume is tracked against the limit         |
| **Triggered** | All resting orders canceled; new orders rejected until the group is reset |

A group enters the triggered state when:

* The rolling 15-second volume exceeds the contracts limit
* A manual **Trigger** action is issued, which cancels all orders regardless of whether the limit has been reached
* The limit is **Updated** to a value below the current rolling volume

A **Reset** clears the triggered state and the rolling volume counter, returning the group to active.

**Delete** removes the group entirely and cancels all resting orders in it.

## Error Handling

Business-logic errors (e.g. order group not found) are returned as rejects. Refer to the protocol-specific pages for error message formats.

# Orderbook Responses
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/orderbook_responses

Understanding Kalshi orderbook structure and binary prediction market mechanics

## Getting Orderbook Data

The [Get Market Orderbook](/api-reference/market/get-market-order-book) endpoint returns the current state of bids for a specific market.

### Request Format

```
GET /markets/{ticker}/orderbook
```

No authentication is required for this endpoint.

### Example Request

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  import requests

  # Get orderbook for a specific market
  market_ticker = "KXHIGHNY-24JAN01-T60"
  url = f"https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets/{market_ticker}/orderbook"

  response = requests.get(url)
  orderbook_data = response.json()
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
  // Get orderbook for a specific market
  const marketTicker = "KXHIGHNY-24JAN01-T60";
  const url = `https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets/${marketTicker}/orderbook`;

  fetch(url)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));
  ```

  ```curl cURL theme={null}
  curl -X GET "https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets/KXHIGHNY-24JAN01-T60/orderbook"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Response Structure

The orderbook response is wrapped in an `orderbook_fp` object containing two arrays of bids: `yes_dollars` for YES positions and `no_dollars` for NO positions. Each bid is a two-element string array: `[price_dollars, count_fp]`.

* **`price_dollars`**: Price as a dollar string (e.g., `"0.4200"` = \$0.42)
* **`count_fp`**: Number of contracts as a fixed-point string (e.g., `"13.00"` = 13 contracts)

Both values are strings to support subpenny pricing and fractional contract sizes. See [Fixed-Point Representation](/getting_started/fixed_point_migration) for details.

### Example Response

```json theme={null}
{
  "orderbook_fp": {
    "yes_dollars": [
      ["0.0100", "200.00"],
      ["0.1500", "100.00"],
      ["0.2000", "50.00"],
      ["0.2500", "20.00"],
      ["0.3000", "11.00"],
      ["0.3100", "10.00"],
      ["0.3200", "10.00"],
      ["0.3300", "11.00"],
      ["0.3400", "9.00"],
      ["0.3500", "11.00"],
      ["0.4100", "10.00"],
      ["0.4200", "13.00"]
    ],
    "no_dollars": [
      ["0.0100", "100.00"],
      ["0.1600", "3.00"],
      ["0.2500", "50.00"],
      ["0.2800", "19.00"],
      ["0.3600", "5.00"],
      ["0.3700", "50.00"],
      ["0.3800", "300.00"],
      ["0.4400", "29.00"],
      ["0.4500", "20.00"],
      ["0.5600", "17.00"]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Understanding the Arrays

* **First element**: Price in dollars as a string (e.g., `"0.4200"`)
* **Second element**: Number of contracts as a fixed-point string (e.g., `"13.00"`)
* Arrays are sorted by price in **ascending order**
* The **highest** bid (best bid) is the **last** element in each array

## Why Only Bids?

<Info>
  **Important**: Kalshi's orderbook only returns bids, not asks. This is because in binary prediction markets, there's a reciprocal relationship between YES and NO positions.
</Info>

In binary prediction markets, every position has a complementary opposite:

* A **YES BID** at price X is equivalent to a **NO ASK** at price (\$1.00 - X)
* A **NO BID** at price Y is equivalent to a **YES ASK** at price (\$1.00 - Y)

### The Reciprocal Relationship

Since binary markets must sum to \$1.00, these relationships always hold:

| Action            | Equivalent To     | Why                                                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| YES BID at \$0.60 | NO ASK at \$0.40  | Willing to pay $0.60 for YES = Willing to receive $0.40 to take NO |
| NO BID at \$0.30  | YES ASK at \$0.70 | Willing to pay $0.30 for NO = Willing to receive $0.70 to take YES |

This reciprocal nature means that by showing only bids, the orderbook provides complete market information while avoiding redundancy.

## Calculating Spreads

To find the bid-ask spread for a market:

1. **YES spread**:
   * Best YES bid: Highest price in the `yes_dollars` array
   * Best YES ask: \$1.00 - (Highest price in the `no_dollars` array)
   * Spread = Best YES ask - Best YES bid

2. **NO spread**:
   * Best NO bid: Highest price in the `no_dollars` array
   * Best NO ask: \$1.00 - (Highest price in the `yes_dollars` array)
   * Spread = Best NO ask - Best NO bid

### Example Calculation

```python theme={null}
from decimal import Decimal

# Using the example orderbook above
best_yes_bid = Decimal("0.4200")  # Highest YES bid (last in array)
best_yes_ask = Decimal("1.00") - Decimal("0.5600")  # $1.00 - highest NO bid = $0.44

spread = best_yes_ask - best_yes_bid  # $0.44 - $0.42 = $0.02

# The spread is $0.02
# You can buy YES at $0.44 (implied ask) and sell at $0.42 (bid)
```

## Working with Orderbook Data

### Display Best Prices

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}

          print(f"Best YES Bid: ${best_yes_bid}")

      if ob.get('no_dollars'):
          best_no_bid = ob['no_dollars'][-1][0]  # Last element is highest
          best_yes_ask = Decimal("1.00") - Decimal(best_no_bid)

# Understanding Pagination
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/pagination

Learn how to navigate through large datasets using cursor-based pagination

The Kalshi API uses cursor-based pagination to help you efficiently navigate through large datasets. This guide explains how pagination works and provides examples for handling paginated responses.

## How Pagination Works

When making requests to list endpoints (like `/markets`, `/events`, or `/series`), the API returns results in pages to keep response sizes manageable. Each page contains:

* **Data array**: The actual items for the current page (markets, events, etc.)
* **Cursor field**: A token that points to the next page of results
* **Limit**: The maximum number of items per page (default: 100)

## Using Cursors

To paginate through results:

1. Make your initial request without a cursor
2. Check if the response includes a `cursor` field
3. If a cursor exists, make another request with `?cursor={cursor_value}`
4. Continue until the cursor is `null` (no more pages)

## Example: Paginating Through Markets

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  import requests

  def get_all_markets(series_ticker):
      """Fetch all markets for a series, handling pagination"""
      all_markets = []
      cursor = None
      base_url = "https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets"

      while True:
          # Build URL with cursor if we have one
          url = f"{base_url}?series_ticker={series_ticker}&limit=100"
          if cursor:
              url += f"&cursor={cursor}"

          response = requests.get(url)
          data = response.json()

          # Add markets from this page
          all_markets.extend(data['markets'])

          # Check if there are more pages
          cursor = data.get('cursor')
          if not cursor:
              break

          print(f"Fetched {len(data['markets'])} markets, total: {len(all_markets)}")

      return all_markets

  # Example usage
  markets = get_all_markets("KXHIGHNY")
  print(f"Total markets found: {len(markets)}")
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
  async function getAllMarkets(seriesTicker) {
    const allMarkets = [];
    let cursor = null;
    const baseUrl = 'https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets';

    while (true) {
      // Build URL with cursor if we have one
      let url = `${baseUrl}?series_ticker=${seriesTicker}&limit=100`;
      if (cursor) {
        url += `&cursor=${cursor}`;
      }

      const response = await fetch(url);
      const data = await response.json();

      // Add markets from this page
      allMarkets.push(...data.markets);

      // Check if there are more pages
      cursor = data.cursor;
      if (!cursor) {
        break;
      }

      console.log(`Fetched ${data.markets.length} markets, total: ${allMarkets.length}`);
    }

    return allMarkets;
  }

  // Example usage
  getAllMarkets('KXHIGHNY').then(markets => {
    console.log(`Total markets found: ${markets.length}`);
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Pagination Parameters

Most list endpoints support these pagination parameters:

* **`cursor`**: Token from previous response to get the next page
* **`limit`**: Number of items per page (typically 1-100, default: 100)

## Best Practices

1. **Handle rate limits**: When paginating through large datasets, be mindful of [rate limits](/getting_started/rate_limits)
2. **Set appropriate limits**: Use smaller page sizes if you only need a few items
3. **Cache results**: Store paginated data locally to avoid repeated API calls
4. **Check for changes**: Data can change between requests, so consider implementing refresh logic

## Endpoints Supporting Pagination

The following endpoints support cursor-based pagination:

* [Get Markets](/api-reference/market/get-markets) - `/markets`
* [Get Events](/api-reference/market/get-events) - `/events`
* [Get Series](/api-reference/market/get-series) - `/series`
* [Get Trades](/api-reference/market/get-trades) - `/markets/trades`
* [Get Portfolio History](/api-reference/portfolio/get-portfolio-history) - `/portfolio/history`
* [Get Fills](/api-reference/portfolio/get-fills) - `/portfolio/fills`
* [Get Orders](/api-reference/portfolio/get-orders) - `/portfolio/orders`

## Common Patterns

### Fetching Recent Items

If you only need recent items, you can limit results without pagination:

```python theme={null}
# Get just the 10 most recent markets
url = "https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets?limit=10&status=open"
```

### Filtering While Paginating

You can combine filters with pagination:

```python theme={null}
# Get all open markets for a series
url = f"{base_url}?series_ticker={ticker}&status=open&limit=100&cursor={cursor}"
```

### Detecting New Items

To check for new items since your last fetch:

1. Store the first item's ID or timestamp from your previous fetch
2. Paginate through results until you find that item
3. Everything before it is new

## Next Steps

Now that you understand pagination, you can efficiently work with large datasets in the Kalshi API. For more details on specific endpoints, check the [API Reference](/api-reference).


# Quick Start: Authenticated Requests
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/quick_start_authenticated_requests

Three simple steps to make your first authenticated API request to Kalshi

This guide shows you how to make authenticated requests to the Kalshi API in three simple steps. For the full production and demo endpoint list, see [API Environments and Endpoints](/getting_started/api_environments).

## Step 1: Get Your API Keys

1. Log in to your Kalshi account ([demo](https://demo.kalshi.co) or [production](https://kalshi.com))
2. Navigate to **Account & security** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create Key**
4. Save both:
   * **Private Key**: Downloaded as a `.key` file
   * **API Key ID**: Displayed on screen (looks like `a952bcbe-ec3b-4b5b-b8f9-11dae589608c`)

<Warning>
  Your private key cannot be retrieved after this page is closed. Store it securely!
</Warning>

## Step 2: Set Up Your Request

Every authenticated request to Kalshi requires three headers:

| Header                    | Description                   | Example                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY`       | Your API Key ID               | `a952bcbe-ec3b-4b5b-b8f9-11dae589608c` |
| `KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP` | Current time in milliseconds  | `1703123456789`                        |
| `KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE` | Request signature (see below) | `base64_encoded_signature`             |

### How to Create the Signature

The signature proves you own the private key. Here's how it works:

1. **Create a message string**: Concatenate `timestamp + HTTP_METHOD + path`
   * Example: `1703123456789GET/trade-api/v2/portfolio/balance`
   * **Important**: Sign the full URL path from the API root, without query parameters. For `https://external-api.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders?limit=5`, sign `/trade-api/v2/portfolio/orders`.

2. **Sign with your private key**: Use RSA-PSS with SHA256

3. **Encode as base64**: Convert the signature to base64 string

Here's the signing process in Python:

```python theme={null}
import base64
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding

def sign_request(private_key, timestamp, method, path):
    # Strip query parameters from path before signing
    path_without_query = path.split('?')[0]

    # Create the message to sign
    message = f"{timestamp}{method}{path_without_query}".encode('utf-8')

    # Sign with RSA-PSS
    signature = private_key.sign(
        message,
        padding.PSS(
            mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
            salt_length=padding.PSS.DIGEST_LENGTH
        ),
        hashes.SHA256()
    )

    # Return base64 encoded
    return base64.b64encode(signature).decode('utf-8')
```

## Step 3: Get Your Balance

Now let's make your first authenticated request to get your account balance:

```python theme={null}
import requests
import datetime

# Set up the request
timestamp = str(int(datetime.datetime.now().timestamp() * 1000))
method = "GET"
path = "/trade-api/v2/portfolio/balance"

# Create signature (using function from Step 2)
signature = sign_request(private_key, timestamp, method, path)

# Make the request
headers = {
    'KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY': 'your-api-key-id',
    'KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE': signature,
    'KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP': timestamp
}

response = requests.get('https://external-api.demo.kalshi.co' + path, headers=headers)
balance = response.json()

print(f"Your balance: ${balance['balance'] / 100:.2f}")
```

## Complete Working Example

Here's the minimal code to get your balance:

```python theme={null}
import requests
import datetime
import base64
from urllib.parse import urlparse
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization, hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding

# Configuration
API_KEY_ID = 'your-api-key-id-here'
PRIVATE_KEY_PATH = 'path/to/your/kalshi-key.key'
BASE_URL = 'https://external-api.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/v2'  # or 'https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2' for production

def load_private_key(key_path):
    with open(key_path, "rb") as f:
        return serialization.load_pem_private_key(f.read(), password=None, backend=default_backend())

def create_signature(private_key, timestamp, method, path):
    """Create the request signature."""
    # Strip query parameters before signing
    path_without_query = path.split('?')[0]
    message = f"{timestamp}{method}{path_without_query}".encode('utf-8')
    signature = private_key.sign(
        message,
        padding.PSS(mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()), salt_length=padding.PSS.DIGEST_LENGTH),
        hashes.SHA256()
    )
    return base64.b64encode(signature).decode('utf-8')

def get(private_key, api_key_id, path, base_url=BASE_URL):
    """Make an authenticated GET request to the Kalshi API."""
    timestamp = str(int(datetime.datetime.now().timestamp() * 1000))
    # Signing requires the full URL path from root (e.g. /trade-api/v2/portfolio/balance)
    sign_path = urlparse(base_url + path).path
    signature = create_signature(private_key, timestamp, "GET", sign_path)

    headers = {
        'KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY': api_key_id,
        'KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE': signature,
        'KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP': timestamp
    }

    return requests.get(base_url + path, headers=headers)

# Load private key
private_key = load_private_key(PRIVATE_KEY_PATH)

# Get balance
response = get(private_key, API_KEY_ID, "/portfolio/balance")
print(f"Your balance: ${response.json()['balance'] / 100:.2f}")
```

| Path not found                    | If your `BASE_URL` already ends with `/trade-api/v2`, pass only the endpoint path to the helper (e.g. `/portfolio/balance`, not `/trade-api/v2/portfolio/balance`) so the request URL is not double-prefixed |
| Signature error with query params | Sign the request path without query parameters. The examples do this with `path.split('?')[0]` after building the full URL path                                                                              |

## Next Steps

Now you can make authenticated requests! Try these endpoints (relative to `BASE_URL`):

* `/portfolio/positions` - Get your positions
* `/portfolio/orders` - View your orders
* `/markets` - Browse available markets

For more details, see the [Complete Order Lifecycle](/getting_started/quick_start_create_order) guide or explore the [API Reference](/api-reference).


# Quick Start: Create your first order
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/quick_start_create_order

Learn how to find markets, place orders, check status, and cancel orders on Kalshi

This guide will walk you through the complete lifecycle of placing and managing orders on Kalshi.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

* A Kalshi account with API access configured
* Python with the `requests` and `cryptography` libraries installed
* Your authentication functions set up (see our [authentication guide](/getting_started/quick_start_authenticated_requests))

<Info>
  This guide assumes you have the authentication code from our authentication guide, including the `get()` function for making authenticated requests.
</Info>

## Step 1: Find an Open Market

First, let's find an open market to trade on.

```python theme={null}
# Get the first open market (no auth required for public market data)
response = requests.get('https://external-api.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/v2/markets?limit=1&status=open')
market = response.json()['markets'][0]

print(f"Selected market: {market['ticker']}")
print(f"Title: {market['title']}")
```

## Step 2: Place a Buy Order

Now let's place an order to buy 1 YES contract for 1 cent (limit order). We'll use a `client_order_id` to deduplicate orders - this allows you to identify duplicate orders before receiving the server-generated `order_id` in the response.

```python theme={null}
import uuid
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def post(private_key, api_key_id, path, data, base_url=BASE_URL):
    """Make an authenticated POST request to the Kalshi API."""
    timestamp = str(int(datetime.datetime.now().timestamp() * 1000))
    # Signing requires the full URL path from root (e.g. /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders)
    sign_path = urlparse(base_url + path).path
    signature = create_signature(private_key, timestamp, "POST", sign_path)

    headers = {
        'KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY': api_key_id,
        'KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE': signature,
        'KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP': timestamp,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }

    return requests.post(base_url + path, headers=headers, json=data)

# Place a buy order for 1 YES contract at 1 cent
order_data = {
    "ticker": market['ticker'],
    "side": "bid",
    "count": "1",
    "price": "0.0100",
    "time_in_force": "good_till_canceled",
    "self_trade_prevention_type": "taker_at_cross",
    "client_order_id": str(uuid.uuid4())  # Unique ID for deduplication
}

response = post(private_key, API_KEY_ID, '/portfolio/events/orders', order_data)

if response.status_code == 201:
    order = response.json()
    print(f"Order placed successfully!")
    print(f"Order ID: {order['order_id']}")
    print(f"Client Order ID: {order_data['client_order_id']}")
    print(f"Remaining Count: {order['remaining_count']}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
```

## Complete Example Script

Here's a complete script that creates your first order:

```python theme={null}
import requests
import uuid
from urllib.parse import urlparse
# Assumes you have the authentication code from the prerequisites

# Add POST function to your existing auth code
def post(private_key, api_key_id, path, data, base_url=BASE_URL):
    """Make an authenticated POST request to the Kalshi API."""
    timestamp = str(int(datetime.datetime.now().timestamp() * 1000))
    # Signing requires the full URL path from root (e.g. /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders)
    sign_path = urlparse(base_url + path).path
    signature = create_signature(private_key, timestamp, "POST", sign_path)

    headers = {
        'KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY': api_key_id,
        'KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE': signature,
        'KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP': timestamp,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }

    return requests.post(base_url + path, headers=headers, json=data)

# Step 1: Find an open market
print("Finding an open market...")
response = requests.get('https://external-api.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/v2/markets?limit=1&status=open')
market = response.json()['markets'][0]
print(f"Selected: {market['ticker']} - {market['title']}")

# Step 2: Place a buy order
print("\nPlacing order...")
client_order_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
order_data = {
    "ticker": market['ticker'],
    "side": "bid",
    "count": "1",
    "price": "0.0100",
    "time_in_force": "good_till_canceled",
    "self_trade_prevention_type": "taker_at_cross",
    "client_order_id": client_order_id
}

response = post(private_key, API_KEY_ID, '/portfolio/events/orders', order_data)

if response.status_code == 201:
    order = response.json()
    print(f"Order placed successfully!")
    print(f"Order ID: {order['order_id']}")
    print(f"Client Order ID: {client_order_id}")
    print(f"Remaining Count: {order['remaining_count']}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
```

## Important Notes

### Client Order ID

The `client_order_id` field is optional, but strongly recommended for order deduplication:

* Generate a unique ID (like UUID4) for each order before submission when you want idempotent retries
* If network issues occur, you can resubmit with the same `client_order_id`
* The API will reject duplicate submissions with the same `client_order_id`, preventing accidental double orders
* Store this ID locally to track orders before receiving the server's `order_id`

### Error Handling

Common errors and how to handle them:

* `401 Unauthorized`: Check your API keys and signature generation
* `400 Bad Request`: Verify your order parameters (price must be 1-99 cents)
* `409 Conflict`: Order with this `client_order_id` already exists
* `429 Too Many Requests`: You've hit the rate limit - slow down your requests

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first order, you can:

* Store the returned `order_id` and `client_order_id` for local tracking
* Amend your order price or quantity using POST `/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}/amend`
* Cancel orders using DELETE `/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}`
* Implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates
* Build automated trading strategies

# Quick Start: Market Data
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/quick_start_market_data

Learn how to access real-time market data without authentication

This guide will walk you through accessing Kalshi's public market data endpoints without authentication. You'll learn how to retrieve series information, events, markets, and orderbook data for the popular "Who will have a higher net approval" market.

## Making Unauthenticated Requests

Kalshi provides several public endpoints that don't require API keys. These endpoints allow you to access market data directly from our production servers at `https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2`.

<Info>
  **Note about the API URL**: Despite the "elections" subdomain, the production Trade API provides access to ALL Kalshi markets - not just election-related ones. This includes markets on economics, climate, technology, entertainment, and more.
</Info>

<Info>
  No authentication headers are required for the endpoints in this guide. You can start making requests immediately!
</Info>

## Step 1: Get Series Information

Let's start by fetching information about the KXHIGHNY series ([Highest temperature in NYC today?](https://kalshi.com/markets/kxhighny/highest-temperature-in-nyc)). This series tracks the highest temperature recorded in Central Park, New York on a given day. We'll use the [Get Series](/api-reference/market/get-series) endpoint.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  import requests

  # Get series information for KXHIGHNY
  url = "https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/series/KXHIGHNY"
  response = requests.get(url)
  series_data = response.json()

  print(f"Series Title: {series_data['series']['title']}")
  print(f"Frequency: {series_data['series']['frequency']}")
  print(f"Category: {series_data['series']['category']}")
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
  // Get series information for KXHIGHNY
  fetch('https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/series/KXHIGHNY')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      console.log(`Series Title: ${data.series.title}`);
      console.log(`Frequency: ${data.series.frequency}`);
      console.log(`Category: ${data.series.category}`);
    });
  ```

  ```curl cURL theme={null}
  curl -X GET "https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/series/KXHIGHNY"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 2: Get Today's Events and Markets

Now that we have the series information, let's get the markets for this series. We'll use the [Get Markets](/api-reference/market/get-markets) endpoint with the series ticker filter to find all active markets. If there are no open markets today, remove `status=open` or use `status=all` to see the full series history.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  # Get all open markets for the KXHIGHNY series
  markets_url = f"https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets?series_ticker=KXHIGHNY&status=open"
  markets_response = requests.get(markets_url)
  markets_data = markets_response.json()

  print(f"\nActive markets in KXHIGHNY series:")
  for market in markets_data['markets']:
      print(f"- {market['ticker']}: {market['title']}")
      print(f"  Event: {market['event_ticker']}")
      print(f"  Yes Price: ${market['yes_bid_dollars']} | Volume: {market['volume_fp']}")
      print()

  # Get details for a specific event if you have its ticker
  if markets_data['markets']:
      # Let's get details for the first market's event
      event_ticker = markets_data['markets'][0]['event_ticker']
      event_url = f"https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/events/{event_ticker}"
      event_response = requests.get(event_url)
      event_data = event_response.json()

      print(f"Event Details:")
      print(f"Title: {event_data['event']['title']}")
      print(f"Category: {event_data['event']['category']}")
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
  // Get markets for the KXHIGHNY series
  async function getSeriesMarkets() {
    // Get all open markets for this series
    const marketsResponse = await fetch('https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets?series_ticker=KXHIGHNY&status=open');
    const marketsData = await marketsResponse.json();

    console.log('\nActive markets in KXHIGHNY series:');
    marketsData.markets.forEach(market => {
      console.log(`- ${market.ticker}: ${market.title}`);
      console.log(`  Event: ${market.event_ticker}`);
      console.log(`  Yes Price: $${market.yes_bid_dollars} | Volume: ${market.volume_fp}`);
      console.log();
    });

    // Get details for a specific event if markets exist
    if (marketsData.markets.length > 0) {
      const eventTicker = marketsData.markets[0].event_ticker;
      const eventResponse = await fetch(`https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/events/${eventTicker}`);
      const eventData = await eventResponse.json();

      console.log('Event Details:');
      console.log(`Title: ${eventData.event.title}`);
      console.log(`Category: ${eventData.event.category}`);
    }
  }

  getSeriesMarkets();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  You can view these markets in the Kalshi UI at: [https://kalshi.com/markets/kxhighny](https://kalshi.com/markets/kxhighny)
</Info>

## Step 3: Get Orderbook Data

Now let's fetch the orderbook for a specific market to see the current bids and asks using the [Get Market Orderbook](/api-reference/market/get-market-order-book) endpoint. This snippet assumes you still have the `markets_data` from the previous step. If `markets_data['markets']` is empty, pick a market from a different series or remove the `status=open` filter.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  # Get orderbook for a specific market
  # Replace with an actual market ticker from the markets list
  if not markets_data['markets']:
      raise ValueError("No open markets found. Try removing status=open or choose another series.")

  market_ticker = markets_data['markets'][0]['ticker']
  orderbook_url = f"https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets/{market_ticker}/orderbook"

  orderbook_response = requests.get(orderbook_url)
  orderbook_data = orderbook_response.json()

  print(f"\nOrderbook for {market_ticker}:")

## Working with Large Datasets

The Kalshi API uses cursor-based pagination to handle large datasets efficiently. To learn more about navigating through paginated responses, see our [Understanding Pagination](/getting_started/pagination) guide.

## Understanding Orderbook Responses

Kalshi's orderbook structure is unique due to the nature of binary prediction markets. The API only returns bids (not asks) because of the reciprocal relationship between YES and NO positions. To learn more about orderbook responses and why they work this way, see our [Orderbook Responses](/getting_started/orderbook_responses) guide.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand how to access market data without authentication, you can:

1. Explore other public series and events
2. Build real-time market monitoring tools
3. Create market analysis dashboards
4. Set up a WebSocket connection for live updates (requires authentication)

For authenticated endpoints that allow trading and portfolio management, check out our [API Keys guide](/getting_started/api_keys).


# Quick Start: WebSockets
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/quick_start_websockets

Learn how to establish and maintain a WebSocket connection to stream real-time market data

## Overview

Kalshi's WebSocket API provides real-time updates for:

* Order book changes
* Trade executions
* Market status updates
* Fill notifications

## Connection URL

Connect to the WebSocket endpoint at:

```
wss://external-api-ws.kalshi.com/trade-api/ws/v2
```

For the demo environment, use:

```
wss://external-api-ws.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2
```

The existing shared WebSocket hosts, `wss://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/ws/v2` for production and `wss://demo-api.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2` for demo, remain supported. For the full endpoint list, see [API Environments and Endpoints](/getting_started/api_environments).

## Authentication

WebSocket connections require authentication during the connection handshake.

Once connected, channels fall into two groups:

* **Private channels (user-specific data):** `orderbook_delta`, `fill`, `market_positions`, `communications`, `order_group_updates`
* **Public market-data channels (no additional channel-level auth):** `ticker`, `trade`, `market_lifecycle_v2`, `multivariate_market_lifecycle`, `multivariate`

In other words, even channels that carry public market data still use the authenticated WebSocket session, but they do not impose additional per-channel authorization checks.

<Note>
  For detailed information about API key generation and request signing, see our [API Keys documentation](/getting_started/api_keys).
</Note>

### Required Headers

When establishing the WebSocket connection, include these headers:

```http theme={null}
KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY: your_api_key_id
KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE: request_signature
KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP: unix_timestamp_in_milliseconds
```

### Signing the WebSocket Request

The signature for WebSocket connections follows the same pattern as REST API requests:

1. **Create the message to sign:**
   ```
   timestamp + "GET" + "/trade-api/ws/v2"
   ```

2. **Generate the signature** using your private key (see [API Keys documentation](/getting_started/api_keys))

3. **Include the headers** when opening the WebSocket connection

## Establishing a Connection

To connect to the WebSocket API, you need to:

1. Generate authentication headers (same as REST API)
2. Create a WebSocket connection with those headers
3. Handle the connection lifecycle

Here's how to establish an authenticated connection:

```python theme={null}
import websockets
import asyncio

# WebSocket URL
ws_url = "wss://external-api-ws.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2"  # Demo environment

# Generate authentication headers (see API Keys documentation)
auth_headers = {
    "KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY": "your_api_key_id",
    "KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE": "generated_signature",
    "KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP": "timestamp_in_milliseconds"
}

# Connect with authentication
async def connect():
    async with websockets.connect(ws_url, additional_headers=auth_headers) as websocket:
        print("Connected to Kalshi WebSocket")

        # Connection is now established
        # You can start sending and receiving messages

        # Listen for messages
        async for message in websocket:
            print(f"Received: {message}")

# Run the connection
asyncio.run(connect())
```

## Subscribing to Data

Once connected, subscribe to channels by sending a subscription command:

```python theme={null}
import json

async def subscribe_to_ticker(websocket):
    """Subscribe to ticker updates"""
    subscription = {
        "id": 1,
        "cmd": "subscribe",
        "params": {
            "channels": ["ticker"]
        }
    }
    await websocket.send(json.dumps(subscription))

async def subscribe_to_orderbook(websocket, market_tickers):
    """Subscribe to orderbook updates for specific markets"""
    subscription = {
        "id": 2,
        "cmd": "subscribe",
        "params": {
            "channels": ["orderbook_delta"],
            "market_tickers": market_tickers
        }
    }
    await websocket.send(json.dumps(subscription))
```

## Processing Messages

Handle incoming messages based on their type:

```python theme={null}
async def process_message(message):
    """Process incoming WebSocket messages"""
    data = json.loads(message)
    msg_type = data.get("type")

    if msg_type == "ticker":
        # Handle ticker update
        market = data["msg"]["market_ticker"]
        bid = data["msg"]["yes_bid_dollars"]
        ask = data["msg"]["yes_ask_dollars"]
        print(f"{market}: Yes Bid ${bid}, Yes Ask ${ask}")

    elif msg_type == "orderbook_snapshot":
        # Handle full orderbook state
        print(f"Orderbook snapshot for {data['msg']['market_ticker']}")

    elif msg_type == "orderbook_delta":
        # Handle orderbook changes
        print(f"Orderbook update for {data['msg']['market_ticker']}")
        # Note: client_order_id field is optional - present only when you caused this change
        if 'client_order_id' in data['msg']:
            print(f"  Your order {data['msg']['client_order_id']} caused this change")

    elif msg_type == "error":
        error_code = data.get("msg", {}).get("code")
        error_msg = data.get("msg", {}).get("msg")
        print(f"Error {error_code}: {error_msg}")
```

## Connection Keep-Alive

<Note>
  The Python `websockets` library automatically handles WebSocket ping/pong frames to keep connections alive. No manual heartbeat handling is required. Learn more about [automatic keepalive in the websockets documentation](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/topics/design.html#keepalive).

  Other WebSocket libraries may require manual ping/pong implementation.
</Note>

## Subscribing to Channels

Once connected, subscribe to specific data channels:

### Subscribe to Ticker Updates

To receive real-time ticker updates for all markets:

```python theme={null}
async def subscribe_to_tickers(self):
    """Subscribe to ticker updates for all markets"""
    subscription_message = {
        "id": self.message_id,
        "cmd": "subscribe",
        "params": {
            "channels": ["ticker"]
        }
    }
    await self.ws.send(json.dumps(subscription_message))
    self.message_id += 1
```

### Subscribe to Specific Markets

To subscribe to orderbook or trade updates for specific markets:

```python theme={null}
async def subscribe_to_markets(self, channels, market_tickers):
    """Subscribe to specific channels and markets"""
    subscription_message = {
        "id": self.message_id,
        "cmd": "subscribe",
        "params": {
            "channels": channels,
            "market_tickers": market_tickers
        }
    }
    await self.ws.send(json.dumps(subscription_message))
    self.message_id += 1

# Example usage:
# Subscribe to orderbook updates
await subscribe_to_markets(["orderbook_delta"], ["KXFUT24-LSV", "KXHARRIS24-LSV"])

# Subscribe to trade feed
await subscribe_to_markets(["trade"], ["KXFUT24-LSV"])
```

## Connection Lifecycle

1. **Initial Connection**: Establish WebSocket with authentication headers
2. **Subscribe**: Send subscription commands for desired channels
3. **Receive Updates**: Process incoming messages based on their type
4. **Handle Disconnects**: Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff

## Error Handling

The server sends error messages in this format:

```json theme={null}
{
  "id": 123,
  "type": "error",
  "msg": {
    "code": 2,
    "msg": "Params required"
  }
}
```

### WebSocket Error Codes

## Complete Example

Here's a complete, runnable example that connects to the WebSocket API and subscribes to orderbook updates:

```python theme={null}
import asyncio
import base64
import json
import time
import websockets
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization, hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding

# Configuration
KEY_ID = "your_api_key_id"
PRIVATE_KEY_PATH = "path/to/private_key.pem"
MARKET_TICKER = "KXHARRIS24-LSV"  # Replace with any open market
WS_URL = "wss://external-api-ws.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2"

def sign_pss_text(private_key, text: str) -> str:
    """Sign message using RSA-PSS"""
    message = text.encode('utf-8')
    signature = private_key.sign(
        message,
        padding.PSS(
            mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
            salt_length=padding.PSS.DIGEST_LENGTH
        ),
        hashes.SHA256()
    )
    return base64.b64encode(signature).decode('utf-8')

# Run the example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(orderbook_websocket())
```

This example:

* Establishes an authenticated WebSocket connection
* Subscribes to orderbook updates for the specified market
* Processes both the initial snapshot and incremental updates
* Displays orderbook changes in real-time

To run this example:

1. Replace `KEY_ID` with your API key ID
2. Replace `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` with the path to your private key file
3. Replace `MARKET_TICKER` with any open market ticker
4. Run with Python 3.7+

# Rate Limits and Tiers
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/rate_limits

Token costs, tier budgets, and burst capacity for the Kalshi API

## Token-based limits

Every authenticated request costs **tokens**. Your tier sets your **budget**: the rate, in tokens per second, at which your balance refills. Your sustained rate for an endpoint is `budget ÷ cost`.

Most requests cost the default of **10 tokens**. For endpoints that cost more or less, [`GET /account/endpoint_costs`](/api-reference/account/list-non-default-endpoint-costs) is the authoritative list of non-default costs currently in effect.

## Read and Write buckets

You have two independent token budgets:

| Bucket    | Covers                                                                                                |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read**  | `GET` endpoints and anything not routed to Write.                                                     |
| **Write** | Order placement, amends, cancels, order groups, the RFQ quote flow, and block trade proposal accepts. |

The split is by operation type, not by protocol. REST and FIX requests drain the same buckets.

## Bucket capacity and bursting

Each budget is a token bucket. The bucket refills continuously at your per-second budget, up to its capacity, and a request is allowed whenever the bucket holds enough tokens to cover its cost. There are no fixed windows and no per-second resets.

Basic and Advanced Predictions Read buckets, and Write buckets above the Basic tier, hold up to **two seconds of budget**. When you spend less than your budget, unspent tokens accumulate, and after two quiet seconds the bucket is full. You can then spend up to **twice your per-second budget in a single burst** before throttling back to the refill rate. This favors event-driven clients that sit idle most of the time and place a block of orders when the market moves.

Predictions Read buckets above Advanced, Perps Read buckets, and Basic-tier Write buckets hold one second of budget. You can spend a full second's budget at once, but idle time banks nothing beyond that.

### Example

A Premier Write bucket refills at 1,000 tokens per second and holds up to 2,000. At the default cost of 10 tokens per order, it sustains 100 orders per second.

| Time      | Requests              | Bucket (capacity 2,000)                |
| --------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 2 s idle  | none                  | fills to 2,000                         |
| 0 s       | 200 orders at once    | all accepted; 2,000 drops to 0         |
| 0 to 1 s  | none                  | refills to 1,000                       |
| after 1 s | 100 orders per second | holds near 1,000; spend matches refill |

## When you hit the limit

A rate-limited request returns `429 Too Many Requests` with the body:

```json theme={null}
{"error": "too many requests"}
```

429 responses do not currently include `Retry-After` or `X-RateLimit-*` headers. There is no penalty or cooldown. The bucket keeps refilling, and your next request succeeds once the balance covers its cost. At a 1,000 tokens-per-second refill, a 10-token order is covered again 10 ms after a 429. Apply exponential backoff on 429.

## Batch endpoints don't save tokens

A batch request costs the same as making each call individually. Every item in the batch is billed separately:

* [Batch Create Orders](/api-reference/orders/batch-create-orders-v2): submitting 25 orders costs `25 × 10 = 250` tokens.
* [Batch Cancel Orders](/api-reference/orders/batch-cancel-orders-v2): cancelling 25 orders costs `25 × 2 = 50` tokens.

The whole batch must fit in the bucket at once. A 25-order create batch needs 250 tokens available when it arrives, or the entire batch is rejected.

## Perps limits use separate buckets

The Perps API uses the same bucket mechanics, including the two-second Write bucket above Basic, but perps traffic is metered in its own Read and Write buckets. Perps calls do not draw down your event-contract budgets, and event-contract calls do not draw down your perps budgets. In effect you have up to four independent buckets: event-contract Read, event-contract Write, perps Read, and perps Write.

Check your perps tier and limits with [`GET /account/limits/perps`](/margin-rest/account/get-perps-account-api-limits), the perps counterpart of [`GET /account/limits`](/api-reference/account/get-account-api-limits).

See the [Perps API](/margin) overview for the full perps surface.

## Tiers and budgets

Per-second token budgets in each event-contract bucket:

<div>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Tier</th>
        <th>Read budget</th>
        <th>Write budget</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Basic</td><td>200</td><td>100</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Advanced</td><td>300</td><td>300</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Expert</td><td>600</td><td>600</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Premier</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,000</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Paragon</td><td>2,000</td><td>2,000</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Prime</td><td>4,000</td><td>4,000</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Prestige</td><td>10,000</td><td>8,000</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

Write bucket capacity is twice the per-second budget above the Basic tier.

## Tier qualification

* **Basic**: complete account signup.
* **Advanced**: call the [Upgrade Account API Usage Level endpoint](/api-reference/account/upgrade-account-api-usage-level).
* **Expert, Premier, Paragon, Prime, and Prestige**: earned automatically from your trading volume (see [Earning higher tiers](#earning-higher-tiers-by-volume) below), or assigned by Kalshi.

## Earning higher tiers by volume

Once a day, Kalshi reviews your trading volume and grants Expert, Premier, Paragon, Prime, or Prestige if you qualify. Your **volume share** is your trailing 30-day volume (counting both sides of every trade you are part of, as maker and as taker) divided by twice the previous calendar month's total exchange volume:

`volume share = your trailing 30-day volume ÷ (previous month's exchange volume × 2)`

A qualifying review grants the tier for **30 days**, and each daily review renews the window while you keep qualifying. Each tier has a higher **Earn** threshold to gain it and a lower **Keep** threshold to hold it, so a brief dip does not cost you the tier:

| Tier     | Earn   | Keep  |
| -------- | ------ | ----- |
| Expert   | 0.075% | 0.05% |
| Premier  | 0.125% | 0.10% |
| Paragon  | 0.25%  | 0.20% |
| Prime    | 0.50%  | 0.40% |
| Prestige | 1.00%  | 0.80% |

If your volume falls below the **Keep** threshold, the tier does not drop immediately. It lapses when your current 30-day grant runs out.

## Your grants

Your tier is the highest level among your active **grants**. Each grant raises you to a level on one lane, `event_contract` (predictions) or `margined` (perps), until it expires, and records its source:

* **`volume`**: earned automatically from your trading volume.
* **`manual`**: assigned by Kalshi.

Fetch your grants from [`GET /account/limits`](/api-reference/account/get-account-api-limits), returned alongside your current `usage_tier`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "usage_tier": "premier",
  "read":  { "refill_rate": 1000, "bucket_capacity": 1000 },
  "write": { "refill_rate": 1000, "bucket_capacity": 2000 },
  "grants": [
    { "exchange_instance": "event_contract", "level": "premier", "expires_ts": 1751558400, "source": "volume" },
    { "exchange_instance": "event_contract", "level": "advanced", "source": "manual" }
  ]
}
```

A grant with no `expires_ts` is permanent. You keep your best grant at each level: a longer-lived manual grant is never shortened by a volume grant, and if you qualify by volume while holding a manual grant near expiry, the grant is extended to a fresh 30 days.


# Request for Quote (RFQ)
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/rfqs

How the Kalshi RFQ system works

Kalshi implements an RFQ (Request for Quote) system for pre-execution communication between members. RFQs allow a requester to solicit quotes from market makers on a specific market and size. Execution follows a two-step lock: accept, then confirm.

RFQs are available on any market, including combo (multivariate event) markets. Combo markets are classified as High Volatility Markets (HVM), which have shorter timing windows (see [Timing](#timing)).

## Interfaces

RFQs are accessible over [REST](/api-reference/communications), [FIX](/fix/rfq-messages), and [WebSocket](/websockets). Quote notifications arrive on the `communications` WebSocket channel, not the orderbook channel.

## Flow

1. **Requester** creates an RFQ specifying a market ticker, size, and whether to rest any remainder.
2. The RFQ is broadcast to all makers.
3. **Makers** respond with quotes containing a `yes_bid` and `no_bid`. Quotes are for the full RFQ size. Each quote is private between the requester and the individual maker; makers cannot see each other's quotes.
4. **Requester** accepts one side of the best-priced quote.
5. **Maker** confirms within the confirmation window. Once confirmed, neither party can withdraw.
6. After the execution timeout, orders are placed on the public book.

## Sizing

When creating an RFQ, the requester specifies size in exactly one of:

* `contracts_fp`: number of contracts, including partial contracts in `0.01`-contract increments.
* `target_cost_dollars`: dollar amount to spend. The exchange derives a contract count from the quote price, returned as `yes_contracts_fp` / `no_contracts_fp` on the quote.

## Quotes

Each quote has two prices: `yes_bid` (price per YES contract) and `no_bid` (price per NO contract). These are typically different. Either can be `"0"` to decline that side, but not both. If `yes_bid + no_bid > $1` the quote is rejected.

Quoters do not specify a size; each quote is implicitly for the full RFQ amount (`contracts_fp`, or whatever count `target_cost_dollars` resolves to at the quoted prices).

Prices must land on the market's price grid. Check `price_ranges` on `GET /markets/{ticker}` for the valid step size.

A new quote on the same RFQ replaces the maker's previous quote.

## Timing

The exchange designates certain markets as High Volatility Markets (HVM). All combo markets are HVMs. HVMs use shorter confirmation and execution windows.

|                         | Standard | HVM |
| ----------------------- | -------- | --- |
| **Confirmation window** | 30 s     | 3 s |
| **Execution timer**     | 15 s     | 1 s |

After acceptance, the maker has the confirmation window to confirm. Upon confirmation, the platform begins the execution timer. At the end of the timer, orders are entered into the book. Fills appear in `GET /portfolio/fills`; match on `creator_order_id` (maker) or `rfq_creator_order_id` (requester).

## WebSocket

Subscribe to the `communications` channel (requires auth). `rfq_created` and `rfq_deleted` go to all subscribers. `quote_created`, `quote_accepted`, and `quote_executed` go only to the involved requester and maker.

## Combos (MVE)

Combo RFQs include `mve_collection_ticker` and `mve_selected_legs`. Use [Multivariate Event Collections](/api-reference/multivariate/get-multivariate-event-collections) to discover eligible combinations.

## Subaccounts

Requesters can create an RFQ under a numbered subaccount by passing
`subaccount` on `POST /communications/rfqs`; makers can likewise pass
`subaccount` on `POST /communications/quotes`. Execution, fills, and
settlement follow the subaccount the RFQ or quote was created under.

The full REST RFQ lifecycle — including combo-market creation — is also
available to [subaccount-restricted API keys](/getting_started/subaccounts#restricted-api-keys),
scoped to the key's locked subaccount. On FIX, restricted keys support the
maker quote lifecycle only.

## Common errors

| Error                  | What's going on                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `invalid_parameters`   | Price not on a valid step, or RFQ already closed |
| `RFQ_CLOSED`           | RFQ was deleted, expired, or already executed    |
| `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Not enough funds for the trade                   |
| `409 Conflict`         | Open RFQ already exists on this market ticker    |


# Subaccounts
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/subaccounts

Isolate balances and positions within a single Direct account

Subaccounts let a **Direct** account partition its balance and positions into
independent buckets under one set of API credentials. Every account has a
primary subaccount (number `0`) and may use numbered subaccounts `1`–`63`.

<Note>
  Subaccounts are currently an **API-only** feature — they are not yet supported in the
  Kalshi web or mobile app. Numbered-subaccount balances and positions are managed through
  the trade API.
</Note>

## Numbering

| Number   | Meaning                                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `0`      | Primary subaccount (the default account) |
| `1`–`63` | User-managed numbered subaccounts        |

## Transfers

You can move cash between your own subaccounts with
`POST /portfolio/subaccounts/transfer` (amounts in cents). Transfers net to
zero at the account level — nothing leaves your account.

Transfers are idempotent on a client-supplied `client_transfer_id`: retrying
with the same value returns `409` instead of applying the transfer twice.

## Listing transfers

`GET /portfolio/subaccounts/transfers` returns your subaccount transfers,
paginated.

## Restricted API keys

When generating an API key you can restrict it to a single subaccount. A
restricted key can only read and trade on that subaccount: order placement and
management, portfolio reads (balance, positions, fills, settlements), order
groups, and the full REST RFQ lifecycle — creating combo markets in
multivariate event collections, creating and cancelling RFQs, posting,
confirming, and cancelling quotes, and accepting quotes. Requests that omit
`subaccount` act on the key's locked subaccount, and naming any other
subaccount is rejected.

A restricted key cannot transfer funds, manage subaccounts or API keys, or
act on RFQs and quotes belonging to a different subaccount of the same
account. Subaccount-scoped requests match rows created through the API with
an explicit subaccount identity; RFQs created in the web app are not
addressable per subaccount. Endpoints outside its allowed set return
`403 this API key is restricted to a single sub-account and cannot access
this endpoint`. On FIX, restricted keys support order entry and the maker
quote lifecycle only — RFQ creation (35=R) and quote acceptance (35=UA) are
not available to restricted FIX sessions.


# Targets & Milestones
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/targets_and_milestones

Using milestones and structured targets in the Trade API

Kalshi exposes two related metadata objects that are useful when working with event and market data:

* `milestones` describe a real-world occurrence tied to one or more events
* `structured_targets` describe a real-world entity that a milestone or market can reference

If you need to group related events, start with milestones. If you need to identify a team, player, or other entity referenced by a market, use structured targets.

## Milestones

A milestone links Kalshi events to a real-world occurrence.

Useful fields on a milestone include:

* `id`, `type`, `title`, `start_date`, `end_date`
* `primary_event_tickers` for the milestone's core markets
* `related_event_tickers` for the broader set of events tied to the same occurrence
* `details` for type-specific metadata
* `source_id` and `source_ids` when external identifiers are available

`details` is flexible JSON and varies by milestone type. For sports milestones, it commonly contains structured target IDs such as `home_team_id` or `away_team_id`.

In practice, `related_event_tickers` is often a superset of `primary_event_tickers`.

For example, a recent `Wyoming General Elections` `one_off_milestone` in Redshift had:

* `primary_event_tickers`: `SENATEWY-26`
* `related_event_tickers`: `SENATEWY-26`, `GOVPARTYWY-26`, and `KXHOUSERACE-WYAL-26`

Those are event tickers, not display titles. In this case they point to the Wyoming Senate, Wyoming Governor, and Wyoming at-large House race events.

That broader grouping is useful when you want all of the markets tied to one real-world occurrence. For milestone types that expose live updates, the same milestone ID is also the key used by the live data API.

### Fetch milestones

Use the [Get Milestone](/api-reference/milestone/get-milestone) and [Get Milestones](/api-reference/milestone/get-milestones) endpoint docs for the supported parameters and response shape.

If you want milestones returned alongside events, use [Get Events](/api-reference/events/get-events) with `with_milestones=true`. The events response includes a top-level `milestones` array alongside `events`.

### Use milestones to group events

A milestone is often the easiest way to find other events tied to the same occurrence. Query by `related_event_ticker`, then read `related_event_tickers` or `primary_event_tickers` from the returned milestone.

Once you have the right milestone, use [Get Live Data](/api-reference/live-data/get-live-data) when that milestone type supports live updates.

## Structured Targets

A structured target identifies a real-world entity that can be referenced elsewhere in the API.

Useful fields on a structured target include:

* `id`, `name`, `type`
* `details` for type-specific metadata
* `source_id` and `source_ids` when external identifiers are available

Like milestone `details`, structured target `details` is flexible JSON and depends on the target type.

### Fetch structured targets

Use the [Get Structured Target](/api-reference/structured-targets/get-structured-target) and [Get Structured Targets](/api-reference/structured-targets/get-structured-targets) endpoint docs for the supported parameters and response shape.

`type` values are not a short fixed list. Integrations should filter by the values they need rather than hardcoding a small allowlist.

## How They Connect To Markets

Markets can reference structured targets through `custom_strike`.

```json theme={null}
{
  "strike_type": "structured",
  "custom_strike": {
    "basketball_team": "2ef4d31c-0b46-4f43-a403-f44d62489034"
  }
}
```

For `strike_type: "structured"`, the value inside `custom_strike` is a structured target ID. You can resolve it with the [Get Structured Target](/api-reference/structured-targets/get-structured-target) endpoint.

For numeric strike types, use `floor_strike` and `cap_strike` instead of `custom_strike`.


# Kalshi Glossary
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/terms

Core terminology used in the Kalshi exchange

Here are some core terminologies used in Kalshi exchange:

**Category:** A high-level discovery grouping for related series, such as sports, crypto, or weather. A series belongs to one category. Use [Get Series List](/api-reference/market/get-series-list) with the `category` filter to browse series in a category.

**Subcategory:** A narrower discovery grouping within a category. A series can belong to multiple subcategories. In API filters, subcategories are often represented as tags; use [Get Tags for Series Categories](/api-reference/search/get-tags-for-series-categories) to discover tags grouped by category.

**Market:** A single binary market. This is a low level object which rarely will need to be exposed on its own to members. The usage of the term "market" here is consistent with how it's used in the backend and API.

**Event:** An event is a collection of markets and the basic unit that members should interact with on Kalshi.

**Series:** A series is a collection of related events. The following should hold true for events that make up a series:

* Each event should look at similar data for determination, but translated over another, disjoint time period.
* Series should never have a logical outcome dependency between events.
* Events in a series should have the same ticker prefix.

## Ticker Conventions

Categories and subcategories help organize and filter series, but they are not part of the ticker convention.

Tickers often follow `Series -> Event -> Market`: for example, the `KXHIGHNY` series may have an event like `KXHIGHNY-24JAN01`, and that event may have a market like `KXHIGHNY-24JAN01-T60`. There are occasional exceptions, so do not parse ticker strings to infer relationships. Best practice is to use the series, event, market, and search endpoints and rely on fields like `series_ticker`, `event_ticker`, `category`, and `tags`.

<Note>
  Please see the "Timeline and Payout" dropdown on a market's page to find the Market, Event, and Series tickers. Note that the market ticker will depend on which market you are looking at on that page. For example, Trump and Harris are each their own market.

# Perps API
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/margin

Getting started with Kalshi's perpetual-futures (perps) trading API

The **Perps API** is how you trade Kalshi's perpetual futures. **"Perps", "margin", and "perpetual futures" all refer to the same product.** The API surface uses *margin* throughout (endpoints under the `/margin` namespace, margin-prefixed fields), so these docs use *margin* for technical references. It mirrors the existing event contract API, so if you're already integrated there you're most of the way there: the margin endpoints follow the same patterns, authentication, and conventions, just under `/margin`.

## Connectivity

### REST API

| Environment | Base URL                                                                              |

| Demo        | `https://external-api.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/v2/margin/`                            |
| Production  | `https://external-api.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/margin/` (rolling out member by member) |

Use the `external-api` hosts for perps REST. WebSocket and FIX use the separate perps hosts listed below.

### WebSocket API

| Environment | URL                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Demo        | `wss://external-api-margin-ws.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2/margin`                            |
| Production  | `wss://external-api-margin-ws.kalshi.com/trade-api/ws/v2/margin` (rolling out member by member) |

### FIX API

The margin FIX gateway uses a **separate host** from event contract FIX.

| Environment | Type                      | Host                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Demo        | Order entry and drop copy | `margin-fix.demo.kalshi.co`                  |
| Demo        | Market data               | `margin-marketdata.fix.demo.kalshi.co`       |
| Production  | Order entry and drop copy | `margin-mm.fix.elections.kalshi.com`         |
| Production  | Market data               | `margin-marketdata.fix.elections.kalshi.com` |

Available session types:

| Purpose                              | Port | TargetCompID |
| ------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------ |
| Order Entry (without retransmission) | 8228 | KalshiNR     |
| Drop Copy                            | 8229 | KalshiDC     |
| Order Entry (with retransmission)    | 8230 | KalshiRT     |
| Market Data                          | 8233 | KalshiMD     |

  * [Error Handling](/fix-margin/error-handling)

### REST API

**What's the same:** authentication, pagination, error format, and core order lifecycle (create, amend, decrease, cancel) all work identically, just under `/margin/*` instead of `/portfolio/*` and `/markets/*`.

**Margin-specific additions:** beyond the mirrored order, market, and order-group endpoints, margin adds endpoints for account balance and risk, funding (estimated and historical rates, plus payment history), fee tiers, subaccounts, and transfers between your event-contract and margin balances. See the **REST** reference for the full list. Two things to know up front: the event-contract ↔ margin transfer (`/portfolio/intra_exchange_instance_transfer`) is **not yet available** (enabled with the production rollout), and you can call `/margin/enabled` to check whether margin is on for your account in a given environment.

**Not available on margin:**

* Batch order operations (`BatchCreateOrders`, `BatchCancelOrders`)
* Queue positions
* Events, series, milestones, multivariate collections, structured targets
* RFQs and quotes
* Historical data endpoints
* Exchange schedule

### WebSocket API

**Same channels:** `orderbook_delta`, `ticker`, `trade`, `fill`, `user_orders`, `order_group_updates`

**Not available on margin:** `market_positions`, `market_lifecycle_v2`, `multivariate_market_lifecycle`, `multivariate`, `communications`

**Timestamp convention:** all timestamp fields in margin WebSocket payloads use Unix epoch milliseconds and an `_ms` suffix.

<Note>
  Margin WebSocket payloads no longer use RFC3339 timestamp strings. The `order_group_updates` channel already follows the same convention: its only timestamp field, `ts_ms`, is Unix epoch milliseconds.
</Note>

### FIX API

<Warning>
  API keys **should not be shared** between the event contract and margin FIX gateways.
</Warning>

**What's the same:** FIXT.1.1 / FIX50SP2 protocol, RSA key authentication, order lifecycle messages (NewOrderSingle, OrderCancelRequest, etc.), order groups, drop copy, and listener sessions all work the same way.

**Key differences:**

|                               | Event Contract FIX          | Margin FIX                                                         |

# Market Ticker
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/margin-ws/websockets/market-ticker

Margin market updates are delivered on a single channel. `ticker` messages include
price, top-of-book size, volume, open-interest, and optional reference/mark prices.

Messages are coalesced to at most one per market per second (latest value wins
within the window).

Requirements:
- no additional channel-level auth beyond the authenticated WebSocket connection
- market specification optional
- supports `market_ticker`/`market_tickers`




# Order Group Updates
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/margin-ws/websockets/order-group-updates

Real-time order group lifecycle and limit updates. Requires authentication.

**Requirements:**
- Authentication required
- Market specification ignored
- Updates sent when order groups are created, triggered, reset, deleted, or have limits updated

**Use case:** Tracking order group lifecycle and limits




# Orderbook Updates
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/margin-ws/websockets/orderbook-updates

Real-time margin orderbook price-level changes.

Requirements:
- authenticated connection
- market specification required via `market_ticker` or `market_tickers`
- sends `orderbook_snapshot` first, then incremental `orderbook_delta` updates




# Public Trades
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/margin-ws/websockets/public-trades

Public notifications for executed margin trades.

Requirements:
- no additional channel-level auth beyond the authenticated WebSocket connection
- market specification optional via `market_ticker` or `market_tickers`




# User Fills
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/margin-ws/websockets/user-fills

- authenticated connection
- market specification optional via `market_ticker` or `market_tickers`
- supports `update_subscription` with `add_markets` and `delete_markets`




# User Orders
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/margin-ws/websockets/user-orders

Private order created/updated notifications for the authenticated user on the margin exchange.

Requirements:
- authenticated connection
- market specification optional via `market_tickers`
- supports `update_subscription` with `add_markets` and `delete_markets`




# WebSocket Connection
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/margin-ws/websockets/websocket-connection

Main WebSocket connection endpoint.
Authentication is required during the WebSocket handshake.




# Price Banding
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/margin/price-banding

How price banding works for Kalshi margin markets

For perpetual markets, prices move in `0.0001` dollar ticks. Bids must be at least the lower of 80% of the best bid or 1,000 ticks below the best bid. Asks must be at most the higher of 120% of the best ask or 1,000 ticks above the best ask.

**Notes**

* Resting orders will not be canceled due to the price band movement.
* If there are no resting orders on that side, there is no band limit for that side.
* Order amends outside the price band are not allowed.


# Kalshi SDKs
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/sdks/overview

Official Python and TypeScript SDKs for the Kalshi API

Kalshi publishes Python and TypeScript SDKs to help you get started quickly.

<Warning>
  SDKs are updated periodically and may lag the API. Active traders should treat the REST [OpenAPI specification](https://docs.kalshi.com/openapi.yaml) and WebSocket [AsyncAPI specification](https://docs.kalshi.com/asyncapi.yaml) as the source of truth. For production, we recommend generating your own client from those specs — or integrating directly — for full control over your implementation.
</Warning>

## Packages

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Python (sync)" icon="python" href="https://pypi.org/project/kalshi_python_sync/">
    `pip install kalshi_python_sync`
  </Card>

  <Card title="Python (async)" icon="python" href="https://pypi.org/project/kalshi_python_async/">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  The old `kalshi-python` package is deprecated — use `kalshi_python_sync` or `kalshi_python_async`.
</Note>

SDK releases track the [OpenAPI specification](https://docs.kalshi.com/openapi.yaml) and are generally published Tuesday–Wednesday each week, ahead of the corresponding API changes; check the package pages and the [API Changelog](/changelog) for updates. All SDKs authenticate with an API key and RSA-PSS request signing — see [API Keys](/getting_started/api_keys) for setup.


# WebSocket API
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/websockets

Trade API WebSocket endpoint and schema reference

Use the dedicated Trade API WebSocket hosts for new integrations:

| Environment | WebSocket URL                                          | Shared host, also supported                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Production  | `wss://external-api-ws.kalshi.com/trade-api/ws/v2`     | `wss://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/ws/v2` |
| Demo        | `wss://external-api-ws.demo.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2` | `wss://demo-api.kalshi.co/trade-api/ws/v2`       |

WebSocket connections use the same API key authentication and signing path as before. Only the hostname changes for the dedicated Trade API path.

* For connection and subscription examples, see [Quick Start: WebSockets](/getting_started/quick_start_websockets).
* For all REST and WebSocket base URLs, see [API Environments and Endpoints](/getting_started/api_environments).
* To generate clients or inspect channel payloads directly, download the [AsyncAPI specification](/asyncapi.yaml).
* For detailed CF Benchmarks channel usage (`cfbenchmarks_value`), see [CF Benchmarks Value Feed](/websockets/cfbenchmarks-value).
* For real-time Pyth prices (`pyth_value`), see [Pyth Value Feed](/websockets/pyth-value).


# CF Benchmarks Value Feed
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/websockets/cfbenchmarks-value

Real-time CF Benchmarks index value updates, each carrying the raw upstream frame plus trailing 60-second and quarter-hour final-minute averages. Requires authentication.

**Requirements:**
- Authentication required
- Index specification via `index_ids` (array of CF Benchmarks index IDs, for example `["BRTI", "ETHUSD_RTI"]`)
- `market_ticker`/`market_tickers`/`market_id`/`market_ids` are not supported for this channel
- You can seed `index_ids` in the initial subscribe, or subscribe first and add indices later
- Use `index_ids: ["all"]` to receive every available index
- Supports `update_subscription` with `subscribe_indices` / `unsubscribe_indices` / `indexlist` actions
- `indexlist` returns the available index IDs (as a `cfbenchmarks_value_indexlist` message) without modifying the subscription
- Ticks are emitted roughly once per second; duplicate or out-of-order upstream source timestamps are ignored

**Use case:** Consuming CF Benchmarks reference index values and their short-window averages

**Subscription workflow:**
1. Subscribe to `cfbenchmarks_value` (optionally seeding `index_ids`). A successful subscribe returns a `subscribed` response with the assigned `sid`.
2. Discover available index IDs with the `indexlist` action; the server replies with a `cfbenchmarks_value_indexlist` message.
3. Add or remove tracked index IDs with `subscribe_indices` / `unsubscribe_indices`, or use `index_ids: ["all"]` to track everything.

**Averaging semantics:**

`avg_60s_data` (always present):
- Window is trailing and per tick: `[source_ts_ms - 60000, source_ts_ms)`
- `window_size` counts prior ticks only
- If there are no prior ticks in the trailing window, the average falls back to the current tick value

`last_60s_windowed_average_15min` (present only in the final minute before quarter-hour close: `:00`, `:15`, `:30`, `:45`):
- Active accumulation window is `(quarter_close_ts_ms - 60000, quarter_close_ts_ms]`
- The start-boundary tick is excluded and the close tick is included
- This produces second-indexed counts: `:01 -> 1`, `:14 -> 14`, `:59 -> 59`, close tick (`:00/:15/:30/:45`) -> `60`
- The field is omitted outside that final-minute window

**Integration notes:**
- If you subscribe without any `index_ids`, no value events flow until you add indices or switch to `["all"]`
- `sid` identifies the subscription stream; use it for `update_subscription` and `unsubscribe`
- Missing `index_ids` for `subscribe_indices`/`unsubscribe_indices` returns an `error` with `code: 24` ("Index IDs required"); unsupported actions return a standard websocket `error`




# Communications
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/websockets/communications

Real-time Request for Quote (RFQ) and quote notifications. Requires authentication.

**Requirements:**
- Authentication required
- Market specification ignored
- Optional sharding for fanout control:
  - `shard_factor` (1-100) and `shard_key` (`0 <= key < shard_factor`)
- RFQ events (RFQCreated, RFQDeleted) always sent
- Quote events (QuoteCreated, QuoteAccepted, QuoteExecuted) are only sent if you created the quote OR you created the RFQ

**Use case:** Tracking RFQs you create and quotes on your RFQs, or quotes you create on others' RFQs. Use QuoteExecuted to correlate fill messages with quotes via client_order_id.




# Connection Keep-Alive
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/websockets/connection-keep-alive

WebSocket control frames for connection management.

Kalshi sends Ping frames (`0x9`) every 10 seconds with body `heartbeat` to maintain the connection.
Clients should respond with Pong frames (`0xA`). Clients may also send Ping frames to which Kalshi will respond with Pong.




# Market & Event Lifecycle
Source: https://docs.kalshi.com/websockets/market-and-event-lifecycle
