# About Hyperliquid

### **What is Hyperliquid?**

Hyperliquid is a performant blockchain built with the vision of a fully onchain open financial system. Liquidity, user applications, and trading activity synergize on a unified platform that will ultimately house all of finance.&#x20;

### Technical overview

Hyperliquid is a layer one blockchain (L1) written and optimized from first principles.&#x20;

Hyperliquid uses a custom consensus algorithm called HyperBFT inspired by HotStuff and its successors. Both the algorithm and networking stack are optimized from the ground up to support the unique demands of the L1.&#x20;

Hyperliquid state execution is split into two broad components: HyperCore and the HyperEVM. HyperCore includes fully onchain perpetual futures and spot order books. Every order, cancel, trade, and liquidation happens transparently with one-block finality inherited from HyperBFT. HyperCore currently supports 200k orders / second, with throughput constantly improving as the node software is further optimized.

The HyperEVM brings the familiar general-purpose smart contract platform pioneered by Ethereum to the Hyperliquid blockchain. With the HyperEVM, the performant liquidity and financial primitives of HyperCore are available as permissionless building blocks for all users and builders. See the HyperEVM documentation section for more technical details.

# Hyperliquid 101 for non-crypto audiences

Hyperliquid is a blockchain designed to upgrade the existing financial system. Just as electronic trading dramatically improved markets in the 2000s, Hyperliquid offers an opportunity for a massive technical upgrade of the existing financial system through a transparent, open, and performant blockchain.&#x20;

Hyperliquid is best known for perpetual futures<sup>1</sup> and spot trading, which drives billions in daily volume. >$1B in annualized fees go toward programmatically buying back the HYPE token. HYPE is used to secure the network, pay for network costs, provide trading fee discounts, and more.&#x20;

In the same way that AWS provides the cloud infrastructure for developers to build on the internet, Hyperliquid provides the liquidity infrastructure for developers to build financial applications. Independent teams using Hyperliquid’s liquidity infrastructure (e.g., mobile apps, trading terminals, self-custodial wallets) have generated >$65M in revenue through builder codes, which monetize user activity<sup>2</sup>. The ecosystem extends beyond trading, supporting borrowing, lending, minting compliant stablecoins, and launching perpetual contracts on any asset.

Hyperliquid modernizes market structure through:

* Transparency: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, meaning anyone can view and verify them in real time.
* Open access: Anyone can use and build applications without centralized gatekeepers.
* Resilience: A permissionless set of independent validators secures the network.&#x20;
* Performance: Up to 200,000 transactions per second can be processed. &#x20;

Core development is led by Hyperliquid Labs, with multiple teams contributing to the blockchain and ecosystem. Development has been fully self-funded, with no VCs or external capital. Hyperliquid’s vision is to be the credibly neutral infrastructure for finance; building from a clean slate is a prerequisite for that neutrality.  <br>

Footnotes&#x20;

1 Perpetual futures (perps) are a type of derivative contract. Compared to conventional futures, liquidity is concentrated in one instrument that never expires, so users don't have to roll positions on expiry or worry about physical delivery. Compared to options, perps also have better liquidity because there is no fragmentation across different expiries and strike prices. Perps are easier for users to understand and a way to express a leveraged directional position without expressing a view on volatility.&#x20;

# Core contributors

Hyperliquid Labs is a core contributor supporting the growth of Hyperliquid, led by [Jeff](https://twitter.com/chameleon_jeff) and iliensinc, who are classmates from Harvard. Other members of the team are from Caltech and MIT and previously worked at Airtable, Citadel, Hudson River Trading, and Nuro.&#x20;

The team used to do proprietary market making in crypto in 2020 and expanded into defi in the summer of 2022. Existing platforms were plagued with issues, such as poor market design, bad tech, and clunky UX. It was easy to make money trading on these protocols, but disappointing to see how far behind defi was compared to its centralized counterparts. The team set out to build a product that could solve these issues and provide users with a seamless trading experience.&#x20;

Designing a performant decentralized L1 with an order book DEX built-in requires an intimate understanding of quantitative trading, cutting-edge blockchain technology, and clean UX, which the team is well-positioned to deliver. The team actively engages with and listens to the community; you are welcome to join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hyperliquid) to ask questions and share feedback.

Lastly, Hyperliquid Labs is self-funded and has not taken any external capital, which allows the team to focus on building a product they believe in without external pressure.


# Onboarding


# How to start trading

### What do I need to trade on Hyperliquid?

You can trade on Hyperliquid with a normal defi wallet or by logging in with your email address.

If you choose to use a normal defi wallet, you need: &#x20;

1. An EVM wallet
   * If you don’t already have an EVM wallet (e.g., Rabby, MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet), you can set one up easily at <https://rabby.io/>.&#x20;
   * After downloading a wallet extension for your browser, create a new wallet.
   * Your wallet has a secret recovery phrase – anyone with access to your private key or seed phrase can access your funds. Do not share these with anyone. Best practice is to record these and store them in a safe physical location.
2. Collateral
   * USDC and ETH (gas to deposit) on Arbitrum, or
   * BTC on Bitcoin, ETH/ENA on Ethereum, SOL/2Z/BONK/FARTCOIN/PUMP/SPX on Solana, MON on Monad, or XPL on Plasma which can be traded for USDC on Hyperliquid

### How do I onboard to Hyperliquid?

There are many different interfaces and apps you can use, including

* [Based](https://based.one/) (web, iOS, Android)
* [Dexari](https://dexari.com/) (iOS, Android)
* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) (iOS, Android)
* [Phantom](https://phantom.com/) (web extension, iOS, Android)
* [app.hyperliquid.xyz](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade) (web)

If you choose to log in to app.hyperliquid.xyz with email:&#x20;

1. Click the "Connect" button and enter your email address. After you press "Submit," within a few seconds, a 6 digit code will be sent to your email. Type in the 6 digit code to login.&#x20;
2. Now you're connected. All that's left is to deposit. Click Deposit to open the deposit window:
   1. You can send USDC on Arbitrum/Ethereum/Base/Polygon to the deposit address shown (or scan the QR code) from a centralized exchange or another defi wallet. Your deposit arrives as USDC on HyperCore.&#x20;
   2. You can also send BTC on Bitcoin, ETH/ENA on Ethereum, SOL/2Z/ANSEM/BONK/FARTCOIN/PUMP/SPX on Solana, MON on Monad, XPL on Plasma, AVAX on Avalanche, or ZEC on Zcash.

If you choose to connect to app.hyperliquid.xyz with a defi wallet:&#x20;

1. Click the “Connect” button and choose a wallet to connect. A pop-up will appear in your wallet extension asking you to connect to Hyperliquid. Press “Connect.”
2. Click the “Enable Trading” button. A pop-up will appear in your wallet extension asking you to sign a gas-less transaction. Press "Sign." &#x20;
3. Deposit to Hyperliquid, choosing from USDC on Arbitrum, BTC on Bitcoin, ETH/ENA on Ethereum, SOL/2Z/ANSEM/BONK/FARTCOIN/PUMP/SPX on Solana, MON on Monad, XPL on Plasma, AVAX on Avalanche, or ZEC on Zcash.
   1. For USDC: enter the amount you want to deposit and click “Deposit.” Confirm the transaction in your EVM wallet.&#x20;
   2. For the others: send the spot asset to the destination address shown. Note that you will have to sell this asset for USDC, USDT, or whichever quote asset is used for the assets you're interested in trading.&#x20;
4. You're now ready to trade.

### How do I trade perpetuals on Hyperliquid?

With perpetual contracts, you use USDC as collateral to long or short the token instead of buying the token itself, like in spot trading.&#x20;

1. Using the token selector, choose a token that you want to open a position in.&#x20;
2. Decide if you want to long or short that token. If you expect the token price to go up, you want to long. If you expect the token price to go down, you want to short.
3. Use the slider or type in the size of your position. Position size = your leverage amount \* your collateral&#x20;
4. Lastly, click Place Order. Click Confirm in the modal that appears. You can check the “Don’t show this again” box so you don’t have to confirm each order in the future.&#x20;

### How do I get USDC onto Hyperliquid?

1. Many CEXs and bridges support withdrawals on Hyperliquid, either via HyperCore or HyperEVM.
2. You can also transfer USDC from other chains via CCTP. For this, you will need USDC and the native gas token on your source chain. The gas is only for depositing. Trading on Hyperliquid is gas-free.
3. Arbitrum is a common chain to receive USDC, if your centralized exchange does not directly support Hyperliquid.
   1. To get USDC on Arbitrum, you can use various bridges, such as <https://bridge.arbitrum.io/>, <https://app.debridge.finance/>, <https://swap.mayan.finance/>, <https://app.across.to/bridge?>, <https://routernitro.com/swap>, <https://jumper.exchange/>, <https://synapseprotocol.com/>, and <https://relay.link/bridge>
   2. Alternatively, you can move funds directly to Arbitrum from a centralized exchange, if you’re already using one.
   3. Once you have ETH and USDC on Arbitrum, you can deposit by clicking the “Deposit” button on [https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade](https://hyperliquid.xyz/trade)

### How do I withdraw USDC from Hyperliquid?

1. On [https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade](https://hyperliquid.xyz/trade), click the “Withdraw” button in the bottom right.
2. Follow the steps. Depending on the withdrawal chain and method, there may be small gas fees to process the withdrawal.


# How to use the HyperEVM

## For users:

### How do I add the HyperEVM to my wallet extension?

You can add the HyperEVM to your wallet extension by using Chainlist (<https://chainlist.org/chain/999>) or following these steps: [ ](https://chainlist.org/chain/999)

In your wallet extension, click “Add Custom Network” and enter the information below: &#x20;

Chain ID: 999&#x20;

Network Name: Hyperliquid&#x20;

RPC URL:[ https://rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm](https://rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm)&#x20;

Block explorer URL (optional):&#x20;

1. <https://hyperevmscan.io/>
2. <https://www.hyperscan.com/>

Currency Symbol: HYPE

<figure><img src="/files/LskykzrVNR4ujRcNMC6t" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### How do I move assets to and from the HyperEVM?

You can send assets to the HyperEVM from your Spot balances on HyperCore and vice versa by clicking the “Transfer to/from EVM” button on the Balances table of the Trade or Portfolio pages or clicking the "EVM <-> Core Transfer" button at the top of the Portfolio page. &#x20;

You can also send your HYPE to 0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222 from either your Spot balances or from the EVM to transfer. Note that this only works for HYPE; sending other assets will lead to them being lost. Each spot asset has a unique transfer address.&#x20;

Sending from the HyperEVM to your Spot balances costs gas in HYPE on the HyperEVM. Sending from your Spot balances to the HyperEVM cost gas in HYPE on HyperCore (Spot). &#x20;

<figure><img src="/files/YA6pPZxJyhtnJNNBhAJf" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### What can I do on the HyperEVM?

Various teams are building applications, tooling, etc. on the HyperEVM. There are many community initiatives to track new releases on the HyperEVM, including:

<https://www.hypurr.co/ecosystem-projects>, <https://data.asxn.xyz/dashboard/hyperliquid-ecosystem>, <https://hl.eco/>, and the #hyperevm-eco channel in <https://discord.gg/hyperliquid>&#x20;

### How does the HyperEVM interact with the rest of the Hyperliquid blockchain?&#x20;

Hyperliquid is one state with HyperCore state (e.g., perps, spot, order books, other trading features) and HyperEVM state. Because everything is secured by the same HyperBFT consensus, there will ultimately be seamless integration between the two. You can build an application on the HyperEVM involving lending, trading, yield generation, etc. That application can directly access the liquidity on the order books, so that defi has CEX-like functionality for the first time. The application token can also list on native Hyperliquid trading permissionlessly, so that trading happens on the same chain as building.

### Why does gas spike?

While the Hyperliquid native blockchain is one of the most performant, high throughput blockchains today, the HyperEVM was intentionally launched with lower initial throughput. Because HyperCore and the HyperEVM share the same state, it is technically risky to allow the HyperEVM to consume more bandwidth on initial launch. The HyperEVM throughput will be increased over time in a gradual technical rollout.

Gas spikes on any chain when there is more demand than supply of blockspace. The HyperEVM uses the same gas system as Ethereum and many L2s, where there is a base fee and a priority fee: <https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md>

### Can I send HYPE on the HyperEVM to a centralized exchange?

First confirm with the CEX that they support the HyperEVM. Note that the HyperEVM is one part of the Hyperliquid blockchain. HyperCore (e.g., perps, spot, and other trading features) and the HyperEVM are separate parts of the same blockchain. Some CEXs support sending and receiving HYPE from Spot balances on HyperCore, but not the HyperEVM. Always remember to do a test transaction when you are trying something for the first time.&#x20;

### How do I bridge assets to the HyperEVM from another chain?&#x20;

There are many different bridges / swaps, including:&#x20;

* Stargate (Powered by LayerZero): <https://stargate.finance/>
* DeBridge: [https://app.debridge.finance/](https://app.debridge.finance/?inputChain=1\&outputChain=999\&inputCurrency=\&outputCurrency=\&dlnMode=simple)
* Gas.zip: <https://www.gas.zip/>
* Jumper: <https://jumper.exchange/>
* Cortex for HYPE: <https://cortexprotocol.com/agent?q=buy%20hype>
* Garden for BTC: <https://app.garden.finance/>&#x20;
* Mintify for ETH: <https://mintify.xyz/crypto>
* USDT0 for USDT0: <https://usdt0.to/transfer>
* Stargate for USDe: <https://stargate.finance/bridge?srcChain=ethereum&srcToken=0x4c9EDD5852cd905f086C759E8383e09bff1E68B3&dstChain=hyperliquid&dstToken=0x5d3a1Ff2b6BAb83b63cd9AD0787074081a52ef34>

## For builders:&#x20;

### What can I build on the HyperEVM?

Any application from other chains can already be built with the limited launch. The HyperEVM is a fully functional EVM of its own. Other features live on testnet will gradually roll out to mainnet.

### How do I set up an RPC? What RPCs are available?

There is one rpc hosted at rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm. Other builders are launching their own as well. Users may run a node, but it is not a requirement to serve an RPC, as all data is uploaded real-time to S3. See Python SDK for an example: <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/evm\\_block\\_indexer.py>.

### How do I get gas on the HyperEVM?

The native token, HYPE, is the gas token on the HyperEVM. You can buy HYPE with USDC on Hyperliquid and then transfer from HyperCore to the HyperEVM. You can also use the bridges mentioned in [#how-do-i-bridge-assets-to-the-hyperevm-from-another-chain](#how-do-i-bridge-assets-to-the-hyperevm-from-another-chain "mention")

### What version of the EVM is the HyperEVM based on?

Cancun without blobs.

### What is the difference between the HyperEVM and other EVMs, like Ethereum?

Functionality is largely the same, which makes it easy to build similar tooling and applications. The main differences are:

1. Dual block system: fast small blocks and slow big blocks
2. Interactions with HyperCore: allowing HyperEVM users to access the order book liquidity, etc.


# How to stake HYPE

You can use different websites to stake HYPE on HyperCore, including:&#x20;

* <https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/staking/>
* <https://stake.nansen.ai/stake/hyperliquid>
* <https://app.validao.xyz/stake/hyperliquid>
* <https://hypurrscan.io/staking>

1. You will need HYPE in your Spot Balance on HyperCore. If you have HYPE on the HyperEVM, you would need to [transfer it from the HyperEVM](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/onboarding/how-to-use-the-hyperevm#how-do-i-move-assets-to-and-from-the-hyperevm) to HyperCore.
2. Transfer HYPE from your Spot Balance to your Staking Balance.

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src="/files/Laryfksq0zzqpgX208nh" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

3. Choose a validator to stake to. Staking to a validator has a 1 day lockup.&#x20;

To unstake, follow the same process in reverse:

1. Unstake from a validator.
2. Transfer from your Staking Balance to your Spot Balance. This takes 7 days.&#x20;
3. After 7 days, the HYPE will appear in your Spot Balance.

For further questions, you can refer to the [Staking](/hyperliquid-docs/hypercore/staking) section.


# Connect mobile via QR code

1. Connect via your wallet extension (e.g., Rabby, MetaMask) on desktop
2. On your phone, click the "Connect" button and select the option "Link Desktop Wallet." You will be prompted to activate your camera and scan a QR code&#x20;
3. On your desktop, click the PC+mobile icon in the top right of the navigation bar and sign the pop-up in your wallet extension. A QR code will appear
4. Use your phone camera to scan the QR code&#x20;


# Export your email wallet

If you accidentally send an unsupported asset to your defi wallet:&#x20;

1. Make sure you are logged in with the same email address
2. Click "Export Email Wallet" in the settings dropdown in the navigation bar
3. Follow the steps in the pop-up to copy your private key
4. Import your private key into the wallet extension of your choice (e.g., <https://support.rabby.io/en/articles/14120234-getting-started-with-rabby-extension#h_be51e8edb6>)&#x20;


# Testnet faucet

To use the testnet faucet, you need to have deposited on mainnet with the same address. Users who have deposited on mainnet may then receive 1,000 mock USDC for testnet use: <https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/drip>

If you are using an email login, Privy generates a different wallet address for mainnet and testnet. You can [Export your email wallet](/hyperliquid-docs/onboarding/export-your-email-wallet) from mainnet, import it into a wallet extension (e.g., [Rabby](https://support.rabby.io/en/articles/14120234-getting-started-with-rabby-extension#h_be51e8edb6), MetaMask), and connect it to testnet.&#x20;


# HyperCore


# Overview

### Consensus

Hyperliquid is secured by HyperBFT, a variant of HotStuff consensus. Like most proof-of-stake chains, blocks are produced by validators in proportion to the native token staked to each validator.&#x20;

### Execution

The Hyperliquid state consists of HyperCore and the general purpose HyperEVM.&#x20;

HyperCore includes margin and matching engine state. Importantly, HyperCore does not rely on the crutch of off-chain order books. A core design principle is full decentralization with one consistent order of transactions achieved through HyperBFT consensus.&#x20;

### Latency

Consensus currently uses an optimized consensus algorithm called HyperBFT, which is optimized for end-to-end latency. End-to-end latency is measured as duration between sending request and receiving committed response.&#x20;

For an order placed from a geographically co-located client, end-to-end latency has a median 0.2 seconds and 99th percentile 0.9 seconds. This performance allows users to port over automated strategies from other crypto venues with minimal changes and gives retail users instant feedback through the UI.

### Throughput

Mainnet currently supports approximately 200k orders/sec. The current bottleneck is execution. The consensus algorithm and networking stack can scale to millions of orders per second once the execution can keep up. There are plans to further optimize the execution logic once the need arises.&#x20;


# USDC

USDC is natively minted on the Hyperliquid L1. Circle's contracts on HyperEVM can be found here: [https://hyperevmscan.io/token/0xb88339cb7199b77e23db6e890353e22632ba630f](https://hyperevmscan.io/token/0xb88339cb7199b77e23db6e890353e22632ba630f#transactions).

See <https://developers.circle.com/cctp/howtos/transfer-usdc-from-arbitrum-to-hypercore> for Circle's documentation on Arbitrum to HyperCore CCTP transfers.

The legacy Arbitrum bridge holds less than 10% of the USDC supply on HyperCore. The legacy bridge and its logic in relation to the L1 staking have been audited by Zellic. See the Hyperliquid GitHub repository for the full bridge code, and the [Audits](/hyperliquid-docs/audits) section for the audit reports.


# API servers

API servers listen to updates from a node and maintain the blockchain state locally. The API server serves information about this state and also forwards user transactions to the node. The API serves two sources of data: REST and WebSocket.&#x20;

When user transactions are sent to an API server, they are forwarded to the connected node, which then gossips the transaction as part of the HyperBFT consensus algorithm. Once the transaction has been included in a committed block on the L1, the API server responds to the original request with the execution response from the L1.


# Clearinghouse

The perps clearinghouse is a component of the execution state on HyperCore. It manages the perps margin state for each address, which includes balance and positions.&#x20;

Deposits are first credited to an address's cross margin balance. Positions by default are also opened in cross margin mode. Isolated margin is also supported, which allows users to allocate margin towards a specific position, disassociating the liquidation risk of that position from all other positions.

The spot clearinghouse analogously manages spot user state for each address, including token balances and holds.


# Oracle

The validators are responsible for publishing spot oracle prices for each perp asset every 3 seconds. The oracle prices are used to compute funding rates. They are also a component in the `mark price` which is used for margining, liquidations, and triggering TP/SL orders.

The spot oracle prices are computed by each validator as the weighted median of Binance, OKX, Bybit, Kraken, Kucoin, Gate IO, MEXC, and Hyperliquid spot mid prices for each asset, with weights 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 respectively. Perps on assets which have primary spot liquidity on Hyperliquid (e.g. HYPE) do not include external sources in the oracle until sufficient liquidity is met. Perps on assets that have primary spot liquidity outside of Hyperliquid (e.g. BTC) do not include Hyperliquid spot prices in the oracle.

The final oracle price used by the clearinghouse is the weighted median of each validator's submitted oracle prices, where the validators are weighted by their stake.


# Order book

HyperCore state includes an order book for each asset. The order book works similarly to that of centralized exchanges. Orders are added where price is an integer multiple of the tick size, and size is an integer multiple of lot size. Orders are matched in price-time priority.

Operations on order books for perp assets take a reference to the clearinghouse, as all positions and margin checks are handled there. Margin checks happen on the opening of a new order, and again for the resting side at the matching of each order. This ensures that the margining system is consistent despite oracle price fluctuations after the resting order is placed.

One unique aspect of the Hyperliquid L1 is that the mempool and consensus logic are semantically aware of transactions that interact with HyperCore order books. Within a block, actions are sorted within each consensus batch (there are usually 1-2 consensus batches of actions in a block) as

1. Actions that do not send GTC or IOC orders to any book
2. Cancels
3. Actions that send at least one GTC or IOC

Within each category, actions are sorted in the order they were proposed by the block proposer. Modifies are categorized according to the new order they place.    &#x20;


# Staking

### Basics

HYPE staking on Hyperliquid happens within HyperCore. Just as USDC can be transferred between perps and spot accounts, HYPE can be transferred between spot and staking accounts.&#x20;

Within the staking account, HYPE may be staked to any number of validators. Here and in other docs, *delegate* and *stake* are used interchangeably, as Hyperliquid only supports delegated proof-of-stake.&#x20;

Each validator has a self-delegation requirement of 10k HYPE to become active. The self-delegation requirement is locked for one year. Any time that the self-delegation for a validator drops below 10k HYPE, the validator enters undelegate-only mode (i.e., where all future delegations to this validator are disabled), so the validator's total stake can only decrease going forward.&#x20;

Once active, validators produce blocks and receive rewards proportional to their total delegated stake. Validators may charge a commission to their delegators. This commission cannot be increased unless the new commission is less than or equal to 1%. This prevents scenarios where a validator attracts a large amount of stake and then raises the commission significantly to take advantage of unaware stakers.

Delegations to a particular validator have a lockup duration of 1 day. After this lockup, delegations may be partially or fully undelegated at any time. Undelegated balances instantly reflect in staking account balance.&#x20;

Transfers from spot account to staking account are instant. However, transfers from staking account to spot account have a 7 day unstaking queue. Most other proof-of-stake chains have a similar mechanism, which ensures that large-scale consensus attacks are penalized by slashing or social layer mechanisms. There is currently no automatic slashing implemented. Each address may have at most 5 pending withdrawals in the unstaking queue.&#x20;

As an example, if you initiate a staking to spot transfer of 100 HYPE at 08:00:00 UTC on March 11 and a transfer of 50 HYPE at 09:00:00 UTC on March 12, the 100 HYPE transfer will be finalized at 08:00:01 UTC on March 18 and the 50 HYPE transfer will be finalized at 09:00:01 UTC on March 19.&#x20;

The staking reward rate formula is inspired by Ethereum, where the reward rate is inversely proportional to the square root of total HYPE staked. At 400M total HYPE staked, the reward rate is approximately 2.37% per year. Staking rewards come from the future emissions reserve.

Rewards are accrued every minute and distributed to stakers every day. Rewards are redelegated automatically to the staked validator, i.e., compounded. Rewards are based on the minimum balance that a delegator has staked during each staking epoch (100k rounds, as explained below).

### Technical Details

The notion of a *quorum* is essential to modern proof-of-stake consensus algorithms such as HyperBFT. A quorum is any set of validators that has more than ⅔ of the total stake in the network. The operating requirement of consensus is that a quorum of stake is honest (non-Byzantine). Therefore it is an essential responsibility of every staker to only delegate to trusted validators.&#x20;

HyperBFT consensus proceeds in *rounds*, which is a fundamental discrete bundle of transactions along with signatures from a quorum of validators. Each *round* may be *committed* after certain conditions are met, after which it is sent to the execution state for processing. A key property of the consensus algorithm is that all honest nodes agree on the ordered list of committed rounds.

Rounds may result in a new execution state block. Execution blocks are indexed by a separate increasing counter called *height*. Height only increments on consensus rounds with at least one transaction.

The validator set evolves in epochs of 100k rounds, which is approximately 90 minutes on mainnet. The validators and consensus stakes are static for each staking epoch.

Validators may vote to jail peers that do not respond with adequate latency or frequency to the consensus messages of the voter. Upon receiving a quorum of jail votes, a validator becomes *jailed* and no longer participates in consensus. A jailed validator does not produce rewards for its delegators. A validator may unjail itself by diagnosing and fixing the causes, subject to onchain unjailing rate limits. Note that jailing is not the same as slashing, which is reserved for provably malicious behavior such as double-signing blocks at the same round.&#x20;


# Vaults

Vaults are a general case of the powerful functionality that HyperEVM enables via CoreWriter and precompiles. Builders can create and tokenize vaults on the HyperEVM with fully customizable accounting. Builders can follow specs such as <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626> with the added benefit of trustless read and write operations on HyperCore. For example, vaults can trade onchain via CoreWriter, or they can delegate any number of authorized agents using CoreWriter. The net result is fully onchain accounting via precompiles, and full access to Core features including spot and HIP-3 in all quote assets.&#x20;

This is a strict improvement over the "legacy" HyperCore vaults, which were introduced in 2023 and do not support HIP-3 or spot trading.


# Protocol vaults

Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) is a protocol vault that provides liquidity to Hyperliquid through multiple market making strategies, performs liquidations, supplies USDC in Earn, and accrues a portion of trading fees.

HLP democratizes strategies typically reserved for privileged parties on other exchanges. The community can provide liquidity for the vault and share its pnl. HLP is fully community-owned.

The deposit lock-up period is 4 days. This means you can withdraw 4 days after your most recent deposit. E.g., if you deposited on Sep 14 at 08:00, you would be able to withdraw on Sep 18 at 08:00.


# HyperCore vaults (legacy)

HyperCore supports a limited set of functionality for onchain vaults, but additional features should be built permissionlessly by builders on the HyperEVM. See [here](/hyperliquid-docs/hypercore/vaults) for more details.

Vault owners receive 10% of the total profits. Note that protocol vaults do not have any fees or profit share. Vaults can be managed by an individual trader or automated by a market maker. All strategies come with their own risk, and users should carefully assess the risks and performance history of a vault before depositing. &#x20;


# For vault leaders (legacy)

### What are the benefits of creating a vault as a leader?

Vault leaders receive a 10% profit share for managing the vault. Traders can share their approach to trading with their community via vaults. &#x20;

### How do I create a vault?

Anyone can create a vault:&#x20;

1. Choose a name and write a description for your vault. Note that this cannot be changed later.&#x20;
2. Deposit a minimum of 100 USDC into your vault.

Creating a vault requires a 10k USDC gas fee, which is distributed to the protocol in the same manner as trading fees.

To ensure vault leaders have skin in the game, you must maintain ≥5% of the vault at all times. You cannot withdraw from your vault if it would cause your share to fall below 5%.&#x20;

### How do I manage my vault?

On the Trade page, select the address dropdown in the navigation bar. Select the vault you want to trade on behalf of in the dropdown. Now, all trades you make will apply to your vault, and everything on the Trade page will reflect your vault.&#x20;

To switch back to your personal account, select "Master" at the top of the address dropdown.  &#x20;

### What assets can a vault trade?&#x20;

Vaults can trade validator-operated perps. They cannot trade spot or HIP-3 perps.&#x20;

### How do I close my vault?

On your vault’s dedicated page, click the Leader Actions dropdown and select “Close Vault.” A modal will appear to confirm that you want to close your vault. All positions must be closed before the vault can close. All depositors will receive their share of the vault when it is closed.

### What happens to open positions in a vault when someone withdraws?

When someone withdraws from a vault, if there is enough margin to keep the open positions according to the leverages set, the withdrawal does not affect open positions.

If there is not enough margin available, open orders that are using margin will be canceled. Orders will be canceled in increasing order of margin used. &#x20;

If there is still not enough margin available, 20% of positions are automatically closed. This is repeated until enough margin is freed up such that the user's withdrawal can be processed. Vault leaders can also set vaults to always proportionally close positions on withdrawals to maintain similar liquidation prices for positions.


# For vault depositors (legacy)

### What are the benefits of depositing into a vault?

By depositing, you earn a share of the profits, or losses, of the vault. You can deposit into the vault of a specific trader to get exposure to their trading approach. &#x20;

Let’s say you deposit 100 USDC into a vault, whose total deposits are 900 USDC. The vault total is now 1,000 USDC, and you represent 10% of the vault. Over time, the vault grows to be 2,000 USDC, while no one else has deposited or withdrawn from the vault. You withdraw 200 USDC (10%) less 10 USDC (10% profit share to the leader), which totals 190 USDC. There may be some slippage as you withdraw and open positions are closed.&#x20;

Note that trading is inherently risky, and vaults’ past performance is not a guarantee of future returns.&#x20;

### How do I find a vault to deposit into?

On <https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/vaults>, you can view statistics of different vaults, including APY and total deposits (TVL).&#x20;

You can click on a specific vault to see more information, such as pnl, max drawdown, volume, open positions, and trade history. You can see how many people have deposited into the vault and for how long they’ve been supporting the vault.&#x20;

### How do I deposit into a vault?

On a vault’s dedicated page, click the Deposit button, then enter the amount you would like to deposit and click “Deposit.”

### How do I check the performance of vaults I’ve deposited into?

You can track any vault’s performance on its dedicated page. Select the “Your Performance” heading to see how your deposits have performed.&#x20;

On the Portfolio page, you’ll find your total balance across all vaults.&#x20;

### How do I withdraw from a vault?

On a vault’s dedicated page, click the Withdraw button, then enter the amount you would like to withdraw and click “Withdraw.”

HLP has a lock-up period of 4 days. User vaults have a lock-up period of 1 day.&#x20;


# Multi-sig

Advanced Feature

HyperCore supports native multi-sig actions. This allows multiple private keys to control a single account for additional security. Unlike other chains, multi-sig is available as a built-in primitive on HyperCore as opposed to relying on smart contracts.&#x20;

The multi-sig workflow is described below:

* To convert a user to a multi-sig user, the user sends a `ConvertToMultiSigUser` action with the authorized users and the minimum number of authorized users required to sign an action. Authorized users must be existing users on Hyperliquid. Once a user has been converted into a multi-sig user, all its actions must be sent via multi-sig.&#x20;
* To send an action, each authorized user must sign a payload to produce a signature. A `MultiSig` action wraps around any normal action and includes a list of signatures from authorized users.&#x20;
* The `MultiSig` payload also contains the target multi-sig user and the authorized user who will ultimately send the `MultiSig` action to the blockchain. The sender of the final action is also known as the `leader` (transaction lead address) of the multi-sig action.
  * When a multi-sig action is sent, only the nonce set of the authorized user who sent the transaction is validated and updated.
  * Similar to normal actions, the leader can also be an API wallet of an authorized user. In this case, the nonce of the API wallet is checked and updated.&#x20;
* A multi-sig user's set of authorized users and/or the threshold may be updated by sending a `MultiSig` action wrapping a `ConvertToMultiSigUser` action describing the new state.
* A multi-sig user can be converted back to a normal user by sending a `ConvertToMultiSigUser` via multi-sig. In this case, the set of authorized users can be set to empty and conversion to a normal user will be performed.

Miscellaneous notes:&#x20;

* The leader (transaction lead address) must be an authorized user, not the multi-sig account
* Each signature must use the same information, e.g., same nonce, transaction lead address, etc.&#x20;
* The leader must collect all signatures before submitting the action&#x20;
* A user can be a multi-sig user and an authorized user for another multi-sig user at the same time. A user may be an authorized user for multiple multi-sig users. The maximum allowed number of authorized users for a given multi-sig user is 10.&#x20;

Important for HyperEVM users: Converting a user to a multi-sig still leaves the HyperEVM user controllable by the original wallet. CoreWriter does not work for multi-sig users. In general, multi-sig users should not interact with the HyperEVM before or after conversion.

See the Python SDK for code examples.


# Permissionless spot quote assets

Becoming a spot quote asset is permissionless.&#x20;

The requirements for becoming a permissionless spot quote asset are as follows:

1. Wei decimals of 8 and size decimals of 2
2. Zero deployer fee share on the quote token
3. 200k HYPE staked, subject to the following slashing criteria based on validator voting:&#x20;
   1. A peg mechanism to a price of 1 USD. A future network upgrade could increase the scope to other non-dollar stable assets&#x20;
      1. QUOTE/USDC should have 100k USDC size on both sides within the price range from 0.998 to 1.002, inclusive&#x20;
      2. QUOTE/USDC should have 1M USDC size on both sides within 0.99 and 1.01, inclusive&#x20;
   2. A liquid HYPE/QUOTE book&#x20;
      1. HYPE/QUOTE should have 50k QUOTE size on both sides within a spread of 0.5%, inclusive

USDC and USDT are not subject to the staking requirement due to their longstanding track record and established scale.&#x20;

The 200k HYPE staked by the deployer are subject to slashing based on validator vote for poor quality quote assets. Upon deployment, this stake is committed for 3 years, after which it can be unstaked. This gives builders and users some assurance when choosing a quote asset.&#x20;

For any of the conditions above, if there is a three-day period during which the condition is not satisfied for a majority of uniformly spaced 1 second samples, the quote asset will be considered slashable. Validators will vote on the amount to slash when such conditions are violated.&#x20;

Becoming a quote asset is now permissionless on testnet, where the staking requirement is 50 HYPE for ease of testing. Once the requirements above are met, the token deployer sends an `enableQuoteToken` transaction to convert the token into a quote token. This deployer action is irreversible and has no gas cost.&#x20;

Transfer fees for new accounts can be paid in 1 unit of a spot quote asset.


# Aligned quote assets

The Hyperliquid protocol supports “aligned stablecoins” as a permissionless primitive for stablecoin issuers to leverage Hyperliquid’s unique distribution and scale together with the protocol.

The motivation behind alignment is to introduce an opt-in setting for new stablecoin teams to bootstrap their network effects and share upside proportionally with the protocol. Similar to the builder-protocol synergy of permissionless spot listings, HIP-3, and builder codes, aligned stablecoins are part of the infrastructure to move all of finance onchain.

### AQAv2

Based on user and deployer feedback, the AQAv2 spec extends the designation of “aligned quote asset” to stablecoins that are not exclusive to Hyperliquid. Under AQAv2, stablecoin deployers share approximately 90% of cost-adjusted reserve yield revenue on their Hyperliquid supply with the protocol.&#x20;

AQAv2 will be a requirement for quote assets to be listed against HIP-4 and validator-operated perp markets on a future network upgrade. There is no trading fee or volume contribution benefit to AQAv2. Other quote assets will continue to be supported for other markets, including spot and HIP-3 perps.&#x20;

AQAv2 allows specification of a “technical deployer” and a “treasury deployer.” The treasury deployer will designate a treasury address which will share 100% of the AQA rate (the cost-adjusted onchain reference rate oracle) with the protocol through the onchain AQA mechanic. This is twice the rate of revenue share of the existing AQA spec. The treasury deployer must stake 500k HYPE, which is slashable if the treasury address does not have sufficient balance for onchain revenue to be deducted. The technical deployer must stake 500k HYPE and ensure reliable mint, redemption, and cross-chain transfer infrastructure for the aligned quote asset. Both treasury and technical deployers require 6 months minimum notice before ceasing operation, during which their stake is slashable for the commitments above. The activation of AQAv2 is by validator vote, after both deployers have staked and sent the authorization transactions from the staking accounts. Under AQAv2, the linked HyperEVM contract that connects to HyperCore will also rebalance with the treasury address. The HyperEVM balance corresponding to minted HyperCore tokens will be held in a ratio of 9:1 between the treasury address and technical deployer’s linked EVM contract address, respectively. Reserve yield revenue accrues in 30 day intervals based on the block on each UTC date, automatically sent to the Assistance Fund 8 days after each interval completes. In the event that there is insufficient balance to deduct from the system interest address `0x50...00 + {token_index}` , the treasury deployer's stake is eligible to be slashed at an interest rate of 2% per day. The 30 day intervals begin on the date of activation.

As a concrete example

```
Jan 1: X1 = balance at 0 UTC, RATE1 = AQA-publisher effective rate, published onchain by validators 
Jan 2: X2, RATE2 (analogously defined)
...
Jan 31: X31, RATE31
Feb 1: X32, RATE32
Feb 7: X38, RATE38
Feb 28: X59, RATE59
Mar 1: X60, RATE60

System interest address pays X1 * RATE1 + X2 * RATE2 + ... X30 * RATE30 on Feb 7 at 0 UTC
System interest address pays X31 * RATE31 + ... + X60 * RATE60 on Mar 9 at 0 UTC
```

### AQAv1

AQAv1 offers lower trading fees, larger market maker rebates, and higher volume contribution toward fee tiers when used as the quote asset for a spot pair or the collateral asset for HIP-3 perps.&#x20;

**Onchain requirements:**

1. Enabled as a permissionless quote token
2. 800k additional staked HYPE by deployer, meaning a total of 1M staked HYPE including the 200k staked HYPE for the quote token deployment. This is to give builders and users assurance to use the aligned stablecoin.
3. 50% of the AQA rate flows to the protocol. Validators may vote to update the calculation methodology as regulatory standards evolve. The AQA rate is updated according to an onchain stake-weighted median of validator-reported values. A CoreWriter action allows the deployer to reflect the exact minted balance from HyperEVM directly to HyperCore, allowing a fully automated fee share mechanism as part of L1 execution.

**Offchain requirements, enforced through onchain quorum of validator votes:**

1. The stablecoin is 1:1 backed by cash, short-term US treasuries, and tokenized US treasury or money market funds to the extent permitted under applicable regulatory frameworks. Aligned issuers must also provide par redemption at all times, with a publicly disclosed and timely redemption service consistent with their applicable regulatory regime. These conditions can be revisited by the validators, in the spirit of building a regulatorily compliant chain for payments and banking opportunities. The guiding requirement is that a large percentage of the world's circulating dollars could compliantly be converted to the aligned stablecoin in the context of existing businesses and use cases in the financial world.
2. The full supply is natively minted on HyperEVM. Any supply on other chains or offchain must first be minted on HyperEVM as the source chain.
3. The deployer can only deploy assets that directly support the aligned stablecoin. For example, the underlying treasuries could be issued onchain. The net effect is that the deployer must share half of its offchain yield income through the existence of the aligned stablecoin. The deployer and its affiliates may not receive any economic benefits tied to conversion of the aligned stablecoin into another asset. "Benefit" includes but is not limited to revenue share, order-flow payments, or any form of rate-linked compensation.
4. The team building an aligned stablecoin must be independent and dedicated to building on Hyperliquid.&#x20;

**AQAv1 benefits, applied to spot and perp trading:**

1. 20% lower taker fees&#x20;
2. 50% larger maker rebates
3. 20% more volume contribution toward fee tiers

Offchain conditions are ultimately voted upon by validator quorum, as any such conditions are not able to be reflected directly in protocol execution. Like on most other blockchains, independent validators on Hyperliquid achieve consensus on a self-contained state machine’s execution. This state machine’s evolution is entirely onchain. In the case of the offchain conditions for an aligned stablecoin, this evolution is driven by validator vote.


# HyperEVM

The Hyperliquid blockchain features two key parts: HyperCore and HyperEVM. The HyperEVM is not a separate chain, but rather, secured by the same HyperBFT consensus as HyperCore. This lets the HyperEVM interact directly with parts of HyperCore, such as spot and perp order books.

### What can I do on the HyperEVM?&#x20;

Explore directories of apps, tools, and more built by community members: [ASXN](https://hyperscreener.asxn.xyz/ecosystem), [HypurrCo](https://www.hypurr.co/ecosystem-projects), and [HL Eco](https://hl.eco/projects). Visit the [HyperEVM onboarding FAQ](/hyperliquid-docs/onboarding/how-to-use-the-hyperevm) for more questions.&#x20;

### Why build on the HyperEVM?

Builders can plug into the onchain order book liquidity of HyperCore via the HyperEVM. In addition, many Hyperliquid users are early adopters and want to try new onchain financial applications. See the [HyperEVM developer section](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm) for more technical details and [tools for HyperEVM builders](/hyperliquid-docs/hyperevm/tools-for-hyperevm-builders) for resources. &#x20;

As one example, a project XYZ could deploy an ERC20 contract on the HyperEVM using standard EVM tooling and deploy a corresponding spot asset XYZ permissionlessly in the HyperCore spot auction. Once the HyperCore token and HyperEVM contract are linked, users can use the same XYZ token on HyperEVM applications and trade it on the native spot order book. This has two key improvements compared to CEX listings: 1) The entire process is permissionless, with no behind-the-scenes negotiations for preferential treatment and 2) There is no bridging risk between HyperCore and HyperEVM as one unified state.&#x20;

As another example, a lending protocol could set up a pool contract that accepts token XYZ as collateral and lends out another token ABC to the borrower. To determine the liquidation threshold, the lending smart contract can read XYZ/ABC prices directly from the HyperCore order books using a read precompile. For a Solidity developer, this is as simple as calling a built-in function. Suppose the borrower's position requires liquidation. The lending smart contract can send orders directly swapping XYZ and ABC on the HyperCore order books using a write system contract. Again, this is a simple built-in function in Solidity. In a few lines of code, the lending protocol has implemented protocolized liquidations similar to how perps function on HyperCore. A theme of the HyperEVM is to abstract away the deep liquidity on HyperCore as a building block for arbitrary user applications.

### What stage is the HyperEVM in?&#x20;

The HyperEVM is in the alpha stage. There are three reasons behind this gradual roll-out approach.&#x20;

First, this stays true to Hyperliquid’s “no insiders” principle; everyone has equal access and starts on a level playing field. The tradeoff is that HyperEVM did not launch with the same tooling you might see on other chains, since no one is given a heads up nor paid for an integration or marketing. These short-term obstacles are worth it to be a fair, credibly neutral platform in the long run.&#x20;

Second, a gradual roll-out is the safest way to upgrade a complex system doing billions of dollars of volume a day and protect against performance degradation or downtime.&#x20;

Third, shipping an MVP and iterating live with user feedback allows development to adjust more nimbly. Testnets are useful for technical testing, but systems can only be hardened through real economic use.&#x20;

As such, higher throughput and write system contracts are not live on mainnet yet, but will be in due time.&#x20;


# Tools for HyperEVM builders

See the [Builder Tools section](/hyperliquid-docs/builder-tools/hyperevm-tools)


# Hyperliquid Improvement Proposals (HIPs)


# HIP-1: Native token standard

HIP-1 is a capped supply fungible token standard. It also features onchain spot order books between pairs of HIP-1 tokens.

The sender of the token genesis transaction will specify the following:

1. `name`: human readable, maximum 6 characters, no uniqueness constraints.
2. `weiDecimals`: the conversion rate from the minimal integer unit of the token to a human-interpretable float. For example, ETH on EVM networks has `weiDecimals = 18` and BTC on the Bitcoin network has `weiDecimals = 8`.
3. `szDecimals`: the minimum tradable number of decimals on spot order books. In other words, the lot size of the token on all spot order books will be `10 ** (weiDecimals - szDecimals)`. It is required that `szDecimals + 5 <= weiDecimals`.
4. `maxSupply`: the maximum and initial supply. The supply may decrease over time due to spot order book fees or future burn mechanisms.
5. `initialWei`: optional genesis balances specified by the sender of the transaction. This could include a multisig treasury, an initial bridge mint, etc.
6. `anchorTokenWei`: the sender of the transaction can specify existing HIP-1 tokens to proportionally receive genesis balances.
7. `hyperliquidityInit`: parameters for initializing the Hyperliquidity for the USDC spot pair. See HIP-2 section for more details.

The deployment transaction of the token will generate a globally unique hash by which the execution logic will index the token.

### Gas cost for deployment

Like all transactions, gas costs will ultimately be paid in the native Hyperliquid token. Currently, the following gas cost is in HYPE.

1. The gas cost of deployment is decided through a Dutch auction with duration 31 hours. In this period, the deployment gas decreases linearly from `initial_price` to `500 HYPE`. The initial price is `500 HYPE` if the last auction failed to complete, otherwise 2 times the last gas price.
2. Genesis to existing anchor token holders are proportional to `balance - 1e-6 * anchorTokenMaxSupply`at the time of the deployed token's genesis. If this value is negative, no genesis tokens are received. In particular, this means genesis holders must hold at least 0.0001% of the anchor token's max supply at genesis to be included in the deployed token's genesis.
3. Potential workaround for constraint (2): a small initial USDC gas fee (value TBD) for the initial state update of each `(address, token)` pair, either through trading or transfer. Further trades and transfers to initialized ledgers are gas free within the standard Hyperliquid fill rate conditions.

### IMPORTANT GAS DETAILS:

The only time-sensitive step of the process is the very first step of deploying the token, where the deployer specifies name, szDecimals, and weiDecimals. This step is when the gas is charged and the token is locked in. It is recommended to take all the necessary time after this step to reduce errors. There is no time limit once the gas is paid.

Deployment is a complex multi-stage process, and it is possible to get in a state where your deployment is stuck. For example, Hyperliquidity and total supply may be incompatible. It is the deployer's responsibility to try the exact deployment on testnet first: <https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/deploySpot>. Gas cannot be refunded if the deployment is stuck.

### Deploying existing assets

One common deployment pattern is to use HyperCore's onchain spot order books for trading an asset that exists externally. For example, this includes assets bridged from other chains or tokenized RWAs like stablecoins. These deployers often use the HyperEVM for minting in order to leverage battle-tested multichain bridging, including the following options:

* LayerZero: <https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/hyperliquid/hyperliquid-concepts>
* Axelar: <https://axelarscan.io/resources/chains>
* Chainlink: <https://docs.chain.link/ccip/tools-resources/network-specific/hyperliquid-integration-guide>
* Debridge: <https://docs.debridge.com/dmp-details/dmp/protocol-overview>
* Wormhole: <https://wormhole.com/docs/products/messaging/get-started/>

To deploy a HyperEVM minted ERC-20 token for trading on HyperCore, the deployer must pay the deployment gas cost in the permissionless HIP-1 Dutch auction on HyperCore detailed above. The gas cost pays for order book and HyperCore token states, which are charged to the deployer instead of future users. The ticker is a unique onchain identifier, but as with all onchain data, frontends may display a different name.&#x20;

For the simplest setup, during the genesis step, the deployer can put the max supply (or `2^64-1` for maximum flexibility) in the system address. See [here](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm/hypercore-less-than-greater-than-hyperevm-transfers#system-addresses) for how system address is determined based on the HyperCore token index. Usually deployers of bridged assets elect not to use Hyperliquidity, which can be configured with the `noHyperliquidity` field.

Once the HyperCore token and HyperEVM ERC-20 address are linked, transfers to the system address on the HyperEVM will reflect in the sender's HyperCore balance, and vice versa. It's highly recommended to test the exact setup on testnet.&#x20;

### USDC&#x20;

USDC is currently used for all perps margining. With HIP-1, USDC also becomes a spot token with an atomic transfer between perps and spot wallet USDC. Spot USDC has `szDecimals = weiDecimals = 8` to allow for a wide range of HIP-1 token prices.

### Spot trading&#x20;

HIP-1 tokens trade on order books parametrized by `base` and `quote` tokens, where limit orders are commitments to exchange `sz * 10 ** (weiDecimalsBase - szDecimalsBase)` units of the base token for `px * sz * 10 ** (weiDecimalsQuote - szDecimalsQuote)` units of the quote token. Any HIP-1 token will be initialized with a native spot order book where the quote token is Spot USDC. Trading of arbitrary pairs of native tokens can be enabled in the future.

### Trading fees&#x20;

Native spot and perps order books share the same volume-based fee schedule for each address. Fees collected in non-USDC HIP-1 native tokens are sent to the deployer, i.e. the deployer's fee share defaults to 100%. The base token deployer can set this percentage in the range of \[0, 100%] but only lower than the previous value afterwards. The portion of base token fees that is not redirected to the deployer is burned. For other quote tokens besides USDC, the fees are sent to the Assistance Fund. Quote token deployers cannot configure a trading fee share.

For legacy tokens that were deployed before the deployer fee share was implemented, deployers can increase the fee share once from zero to a positive value. After this one-time change, the fee share can only decrease. The deployer fee share for legacy tokens cannot be set back to exactly zero after being set to a positive value.

### Spot dust conversion

Spot dusting occurs once a day at 00:00 UTC. All spot balances that are less than 1 lot size with notional value <= 1 USD will be dusted. Here, the notional value is computed as the prevailing mid price of the token against USDC, times the token balance. All users’ dust across a token is aggregated, and a market sell order is automatically submitted to the book. If the aggregate dust is smaller than one lot size, then that dust is burned. Otherwise, the USDC from the successfully converted dust will be allocated back to all dusted users on a weighted basis, where the weighting is equal to the user’s fraction of the aggregate dust.&#x20;

Dusting will not occur if 1) the book is one-sided or 2) the amount of notional dust is too high such that the book would be impacted by this operation. For PURR, this is 10000 USDC; for all other tokens, this is 3000 USDC. Note: the amount of USDC received may be less than the notional amount computed from the mid because of slippage incurred while dusting or if there was insufficient liquidity to convert the total dust across all users.&#x20;


# HIP-2: Hyperliquidity

### Motivation&#x20;

Though HIP-1 is sufficient as a permissionless token standard, in practice it is often crucial to bootstrap liquidity. One of Hyperliquid's core design principles is that liquidity should be democratized. For perps trading, HLP can quote deep and tight liquidity based on CEX perp and spot prices, but a new model is needed for HIP-1 tokens that are in early phases of price discovery.

Hyperliquidity is inspired by Uniswap, while interoperating with a native onchain order book to support sophisticated order book liquidity from end users. HIP-2 is a fully decentralized onchain strategy that is part of Hyperliquid's block transition logic. Unlike conventional automated order book strategies, there are no operators. The strategy logic is secured by the same consensus that operates the order book itself. Note that Hyperliquidity is currently only available on spot pairs against USDC.&#x20;

Hyperliquidity is parametrized by

1. `spot`: a spot order book asset with USDC quote returned by a deployment of HIP-1
2. `startPx`: the initial price of the range
3. `nOrders`: the number of orders in the range
4. `orderSz`: the size of a full order in the range
5. `nSeededLevels`: the number of levels that begin as bids instead of asks. Note that for each additional bid level added by incrementing `nSeededLevels` the deployer needs to fund Hyperliquidity with `px * sz` worth of USDC. For fixed `nOrders`, increasing seeded levels decreases the total supply because it reduces the genesis supply of Hyperliquidity.

Each Hyperliquidity strategy has a price range defined recursively `px_0 = startPx`, `px_i = round(px_{i-1} * 1.003)`. The strategy updates on every block where the block time is at least 3 seconds since the previous update block. After each update:

1. Strategy targets `nFull = floor(balance / orderSz)` full ask orders and a `balance % orderSz` partial ask order if the partial order is nonzero. To the extent that ALO orders are not rejected, these orders are ensured.
2. Each fully filled tranche is modified to an order of size `orderSz` on the side with available balance, with the exception of the single partial order from (1) if it exists.

The resulting strategy guarantees a 0.3% spread every 3 seconds. Like smart-contract based pools on general-purpose chains, Hyperliquidity requires no maintenance in the form of user transactions. One key improvement is that Hyperliquidity participates in a general-purpose order book. Active liquidity providers can join in liquidity provision alongside Hyperliquidity at any time, allowing markets to adapt to increasing demand for liquidity.


# HIP-3: Builder-deployed perpetuals

The Hyperliquid protocol supports permissionless builder-deployed perps (HIP-3), a key milestone toward fully decentralizing the perp listing process.&#x20;

The deployer of a perp market is responsible for

1. Market definition, including the oracle definition and contract specifications
2. Market operation, including setting oracle prices, leverage limits, and settling the market if needed

HIP-3 inherits the HyperCore stack including its high performance margining and order books. For example, the API to trade HIP-3 perps is unified with other HyperCore actions. To trade HIP-3 assets, the asset ID simply needs to be set using the schema [here](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/asset-ids).

### Spec

1. The staking requirement for mainnet will be 500k HYPE. This requirement is expected to decrease over time as the infrastructure matures. Any amount staked above the most recent requirement can be unstaked. The staking requirement is maintained for a minimum of 183 days after the dex is deployed.
2. Any deployer that meets the staking requirement can deploy one perp dex. As a reminder, each perp dex features independent margining, order books, and deployer settings. A future upgrade may support multiple dex deployments sharing the same deployer and staking requirement.
3. Any quote asset can be used as the collateral asset for a dex. As a reminder, assets that fail to meet the permissionless quote asset requirements will lose quote asset status based on onchain validator vote. Such a vote would also disable perp dexs that use this asset as collateral. A deployer-initiated disabling of quote asset does not disable the corresponding perp dexs.
4. HIP-3 deployers are not subject to slashing related to quote assets. On a future upgrade, dexs with disabled quote assets would support migration to a new collateral token. This is not expected to happen on mainnet, as quote token deployers have their separate staking and slashing conditions. In summary, the quote asset choice is important for trading fee and product considerations, but is not an existential risk for HIP-3 deployers.
5. The first 3 assets deployed in any perp dex do not require auction participation. Additional assets go through a Dutch auction with the same hyperparameters (including frequency and minimum price) as the HIP-1 auction. The HIP-3 auction for additional perps is shared across all perp dexs. Future upgrades will support improved ergonomics around reserving assets for time-sensitive future deployments. Deployers also get `7 + 0.2 * n_auction_deployments` reserve deployments that can be used at the current auction price, but bypassing the auction timer.
6. HIP-3 markets incorporate the usual sources of trading fee discounts, including staking discounts, referral rewards, and aligned collateral discount. HIP-3 deployers can configure an additional fee share between 0-300% (0-100% for growth mode). If the share is above 100%, the protocol fee is also increased to be equal to the deployer fee.
7. Aligned stablecoin collateral will automatically receive reduced fees once the alignment condition (which is being updated based on user and deployer feedback) is implemented.

### Settlement

The deployer may settle an asset using the `haltTrading` action. This cancels all orders and settles positions to the current mark price. The same action can be used to resume trading, effectively recycling the asset. This could be used to list dated contracts without participating in the deployment auction for each new contract.

Once all assets are settled, a deployer's required stake is free to be unstaked.

### Oracle

While the oracle is completely general at the protocol level, perps make the most mathematical sense when there is a well-defined underlying asset or data feed which is difficult to manipulate and has underlying economic significance. Most price indices are not amenable as perp oracle sources. Deployers should consider edge cases carefully before listing markets, as they are subject to slashing for all listed markets on their DEX.

### Slashing&#x20;

Note: in all usages below, "slashing" is only in the context of HIP-3.&#x20;

To ensure high quality markets and protect users, deployers must maintain 500k staked HYPE. In the event of malicious market operation, validators have the authority to slash the deployer’s stake by conducting a stake-weighted vote. Even if the deployer has unstaked and initiated a staking withdrawal, the stake is still slashable during the 7-day unstaking queue.&#x20;

While slashing is ultimately by validator quorum, the protocol guidelines have been distilled from careful testnet analysis, user feedback, and deployer feedback. The guiding principle is that slashing is to prevent behavior that jeopardizes protocol correctness, uptime, or performance. A useful rule of thumb is that any slashable behavior should be accompanied by a bug fix in the protocol implementation. Therefore, HIP-3 should not require slashing in its final state. However, slashing is an important safety mechanism for a practical rollout of this large feature set.&#x20;

Slashing is technical and does not distinguish between malicious and incompetent behavior. Relatedly, slashing does not distinguish between

1. A deployer that deviates from a well-designed contract spec
2. A deployer that faithfully follows a poorly designed contract spec
3. A deployer whose private keys are compromised

The key factor is the effect of the deployer's actions on the protocol. Note that any bugs discovered are generously covered by the bug bounty program, provided such discoveries meet the terms of that program, including being responsibly disclosed without being exploited. These reports are greatly appreciated.&#x20;

Even attempted malicious deployer inputs that do not cause protocol issues are slashable. Similarly, inputs that do cause protocol issues but that are not irregular are not slashable. In particular, bugs under normal operation that are unrelated to the deployer inputs are not within scope of slashing. The interpretation of "irregular" inputs is to be determined by validator vote, and includes inputs that exploit edge cases or loopholes that circumvent system limits. All deployer transactions are onchain, and can be independently analyzed by any interested parties.&#x20;

Some malicious behavior is valid by protocol definition, but incorrect by certain subjective interpretations. The slashing principle provides that the protocol should not intervene in subjective matters. The motivation is that while proof-of-stake blockchains could hard fork on undesirable state transitions, they very rarely do. Neutrality of the platform is an incredibly important feature to preserve. Relatedly, the slashed stake by the deployer is burned instead of being distributed to affected users. This is again based on proof-of-stake principles and prevents some forms of misaligned incentives between users and deployers. While the protocol layer does not enforce subjective irregularities, the downstream application and social layers can. Ultimately, the deployer's reputation and future success are always at stake.&#x20;

The amount slashed in a given instance is ultimately a stake-weighted median of validator votes. However, as a general guideline, irregular inputs that cause invalid state transitions or prolonged network downtime can be slashed up to 100%. Irregular inputs causing brief network downtime can be partially slashed up to 50%. Invalid inputs that cause network degradation or performance issues can be partially slashed up to 20%.&#x20;

Lastly, the slashing conditions are independent of the staker composition. Therefore, LST operators should carefully diligence deployers. LST operators should also carefully and clearly communicate slashing risks to their users. A self-bonding requirement for deployers could make sense.&#x20;

In the most likely outcome, slashing never happens on mainnet. A large amount of technical work has gone into making HIP-3 a self-contained and technically robust system. Barring implementation issues, HIP-3 inherits Hyperliquid's carefully designed mathematical solvency guarantees.

### Cross margin

IMPORTANT: Enabling cross margin on an asset is irreversible. Deployers should carefully consider the conditions below before enabling.

Despite the system-level protection, users still take greater risk when using cross margin across DEXs with different deployers. To better protect users, mainnet validators will enforce that HIP-3 deployers only enable cross margin on assets that satisfy defined eligibility standards, including: sufficient observable liquidity, a reliable external oracle source, and resilience to price manipulation. In particular, each time the \`externalPerpPx\` of an asset moves more than 50% relative to the start of day price, validators will conduct a review to determine whether the deployer should be slashed due to manipulation. Assets where 50% daily moves are expected more than once a month are ineligible for cross margin and are subject to deployer slashing.

### Backstop liquidator

Each HIP-3 DEX is associated with a fully onchain strategy at `0x400..00 + {dex_index}` that takes over backstop liquidatable positions from the designated HIP-3 DEX. The onchain backstop liquidators only accept assets where cross margin is enabled, making those assets significantly less likely to experience ADL going forward during high volatility events. Each DEX’s onchain backstop liquidator is an independent user and falls back to ADL to mathematically guarantee solvency of the DEX.

There is no action item for users. Once scaled out, the backstop liquidators will absorb undercollateralized positions while simultaneously avoiding bad debt and reducing the need for ADL.


# HIP-4: Outcome markets

### Overview

Outcomes are fully collateralized contracts that settle within a fixed range. HIP-4 is a general-purpose primitive that is useful for applications such as prediction markets and bounded options-like instruments.&#x20;

Outcomes bring non-linearity, dated contracts, and an alternative form of derivative trading that does not involve leverage or liquidations. The outcome primitive expands the expressivity of HyperCore, while composing with other primitives such as portfolio margin and the HyperEVM.

The first market is a recurring binary outcome that settles daily at 06:00 UTC to the BTC mark price on HyperCore mark prices. See the spec [here](/hyperliquid-docs/trading/contract-specifications#recurring-outcomes). Multi-outcome markets will be supported but are not part of the initial mainnet release. Additional features and markets will be rolled out in stages.

The outcome trading API is similar to spot, with key differences highlighted here: <https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/asset-ids>.

### Mechanics

Each outcome market consists of two sides, each with a token. The tokens are labeled by `sideSpecs` in the `outcomeMeta` info endpoint, often `Yes` and `No`. Settlement automatically converts either Yes to `settleFraction` quote tokens and No to `1 - settleFraction` quote tokens. In particular, `settleFraction = 1` for "binary yes" and `settleFraction = 0` for "binary no" settlement.

The order books of Yes and No tokens for the same outcome are merged to share liquidity. For example, an order to buy Yes at price `p` is equivalent to an order to sell No at price `1-p`. Under the merged book, price-time priority generalizes to price-side-time priority. In other words, *for orders at the same merged price level*, the resting sell orders are sorted before all resting buy dual orders. Advanced users may also manually split and merge outcomes to convert between primary and dual balances. See [here](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/exchange-endpoint#split-outcome) for API examples.

Most operations abstract the dual book's liquidity from the user's perspective. However, there are a few examples whose ergonomics will be improved on a future network upgrade. For example, historical orders can return the primary and dual orders separately if a user sends an order that both matches and rests on the book.

*Questions* are collections of outcomes where exactly one outcome will settle to Yes, and all others will settle to No. Each outcome trades on a separate order book, but is linked by `negate` and `merge` operations. See [here](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/exchange-endpoint#negate-outcome) for API examples. In other words, users with No shares on different outcomes of the same question can redeem quote tokens before the underlying outcomes settle.

Fees are currently zero for outcome markets for initial testing. However, builder codes do work the same as normal spot trading, where builders earn builder fees on sell orders that specify their builder code.&#x20;


# Frontend checks

There are many ways to reach invalid configurations during the spot deploy process. To avoid this, deployers can try intended deployments on testnet first. For automated deployment integrations, the following is a list of client-side checks that may be helpful.

### Token Deployment

```typescript
    if (szDecimals === undefined || weiDecimals === undefined) {
      displayAlert(
        "Size decimals and Wei decimals must be specified.",

      );
      return;
    }
    if (szDecimals > 2 || szDecimals < 0) {
      displayAlert("Size decimals must be between 0 and 2.", "error");
      return;
    }
    if (weiDecimals > 8 || weiDecimals < 0) {

# Trading


# Fees

Fees are based on your rolling 14 day volume and are assessed at the end of each day in UTC. Sub-account volume counts toward the master account and all sub-accounts share the same fee tier. Vault volume is treated separately from the master account. Referral rewards apply for a user's first $1B in volume and referral discounts apply for a user's first $25M in volume.

Maker rebates are paid out continuously on each trade directly to the trading wallet.&#x20;

There are separate fee schedules for perps vs spot. Perps and spot volume will be counted together to determine your fee tier, and spot volume will count double toward your fee tier. i.e., `(14d weighted volume) = (14d perps volume) + 2 * (14d spot volume)`.

For each user, there is one fee tier across all assets, including perps, HIP-3 perps, and spot. When growth mode is activated for an HIP-3 perp, protocol fees, rebates, volume contributions, and L1 user rate limit contributions are reduced by 90%. HIP-3 deployers can configure an additional fee share between 0-300% (0-100% for growth mode). If the share is above 100%, the protocol fee is also increased to be equal to the deployer fee.

Spot pairs between two spot quote assets have 80% lower taker fees, maker rebates, and user volume contribution.

[Aligned quote assets](/hyperliquid-docs/hypercore/aligned-quote-assets) benefit from 20% lower taker fees, 50% better maker rebates, and 20% more volume contribution toward fee tiers.

### Staking tiers

| Tier     | HYPE staked | Trading fee discount |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| Wood     | >10         | 5%                   |
| Bronze   | >100        | 10%                  |
| Silver   | >1,000      | 15%                  |
| Gold     | >10,000     | 20%                  |
| Platinum | >100,000    | 30%                  |
| Diamond  | >500,000    | 40%                  |

### Maker rebates

| Tier | 14d weighted maker volume | Maker fee |
| ---- | ------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | >0.5%                     | -0.001%   |
| 2    | >1.5%                     | -0.002%   |
| 3    | >3.0%                     | -0.003%   |

On most other protocols, the team or insiders are the main beneficiaries of fees. On Hyperliquid, fees are entirely directed to the community (HLP, the assistance fund, and deployers). Spot and HIP-3 perp deployers may choose to keep up to 50% of trading fees generated by their deployed assets. The assistance fund uses the system address `0xfefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefefe`. It converts trading fees to HYPE in a fully automated manner as part of the L1 execution. HYPE in the assistance fund is burned, removing the tokens permanently from the circulating and total supply.

### Growth mode for HIP-3 perps

When a deployer activates growth mode, there is a ≥90% reduction on the all-in fees. Rebates and volume contributions will also be ≥90% lower. Growth mode applies on top of other multipliers, such as staking discounts. The following two conditions apply for growth mode:

1. The deployer fee scale must be set between 0 and 1. As a reminder, deployer fee scale is the amount the deployer keeps as a percentage of the user’s fees before applying aligned stablecoin collateral discount, if applicable. For more information, see: [HIP-3 deployer actions](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/hip-3-deployer-actions). Setting growth mode has a 30 day cooldown per asset.
2. The markets must be entirely disjoint from existing validator-operated perps to prevent parasitic volume. For example, the below are not eligible for growth mode. This list of examples is illustrative and not comprehensive. Similar to delistings, the ultimate decider for disabling ineligible growth mode perps is onchain validator vote.
   1. Crypto perps against any collateral&#x20;
   2. Perps on crypto indexes, ETFs, or other baskets of crypto assets&#x20;
   3. Perps on mathematical combinations including crypto assets, such as a linear combination of BTC and another asset’s price
   4. Perps on vehicles or wrappers that hold primarily crypto assets&#x20;
   5. Perps tracking gold price, because PAXG-USDC already tracks gold price&#x20;

In summary, the baseline all-in taker rate under growth mode will be between 0.0045%-0.009% (5-10x lower than the 0.045% baseline fee for validator-operated perps).

### Staking linking

A "staking user" and a "trading user" can be linked so that the staking user's HYPE staked can be attributed to the trading user's fees. A few important points to note:

* The staking user and the trading user must be controlled by the same user. For security purposes, the staking user will be able to unilaterally transfer all funds from the trading user to the staking user's account in a single irreversible transaction. A trading user should therefore never link to a staking user that is controlled by another user.
  * A staking user may send EIP-712 signed action with primary type `HyperliquidTransaction:StakingLinkDisableTradingUser` and payload `{tradingUser: String, nonce: Number}` that renders the trading user unusable and funds locked. In 1 year after locking, the funds from the trading user are automatically transferred to the staking user. This action is irreversible and not recommended under normal operation.
* Linking is permanent. Unlinking is not supported.
* The staking user will not receive any staking-related fee discount after being linked.
* Linking requires the trading user to send an action first, and then the staking user to finalize the link. See "Link Staking" at app.hyperliquid.xyz/portfolio for details.&#x20;
* No action is required if you plan to trade and stake from the same address.&#x20;

### Outcome tokens

Outcome trading only charges fees when closing or settling, not when opening outcome positions. Only fee-paying volume is counted for outcome trading. There are 6 cases for outcome trades which are special cases of this logic:

1\. Minting, no one pays fee: no volume is counted

2a. Normal Trade where one side pays fee: both users get `fee_paying_px * sz`

2b. Normal Trade where no one pays fee: no volume is counted

3a. Burning, both sides pay fee: both users get `(maker_px + taker_px) * sz = 1 * sz`

3b. Burning, only taker pays fee: both users get `taker_px * sz`

4\. Settlement: each user gets `settle_fraction * sz`

Outcome trading does not support rebates. Users who would receive rebates for spot and perp trading pay zero fees on maker orders.

### Fee formula for developers

```typescript
type Args =
  | {
      type: "spot";
      isStablePair: boolean;
    }
  | {
      type: "perp";
      deployerFeeScale: number;
      growthMode: boolean;
    };

function feeRates(
  fees: { makerRate: number; takerRate: number }, // fees from userFees info endpoint
  activeReferralDiscount: number, // number from userFees info endpoint
  isAlignedQuoteToken: boolean,
  args: Args,
) {
  const scaleIfStablePair = args.type === "spot" && args.isStablePair ? 0.2 : 1;
  let scaleIfHip3 = 1;
  let growthModeScale = 1;
  let deployerShare = 0;
  if (args.type === "perp") {
    scaleIfHip3 =
      args.deployerFeeScale < 1
        ? args.deployerFeeScale + 1
        : args.deployerFeeScale * 2;
    deployerShare =
      args.deployerFeeScale < 1
        ? args.deployerFeeScale / (1 + args.deployerFeeScale)
        : 0.5;
    growthModeScale = args.growthMode ? 0.1 : 1;
  }

  let makerPercentage =
    fees.makerRate * 100 * scaleIfStablePair * growthModeScale;
  if (makerPercentage > 0) {
    makerPercentage *= scaleIfHip3 * (1 - activeReferralDiscount);
  } else {
    const makerRebateScaleIfAlignedQuoteToken = isAlignedQuoteToken
      ? (1 - deployerShare) * 1.5 + deployerShare
      : 1;
    makerPercentage *= makerRebateScaleIfAlignedQuoteToken;
  }

  let takerPercentage =
    fees.takerRate *
    100 *
    scaleIfStablePair *
    scaleIfHip3 *
    growthModeScale *
    (1 - activeReferralDiscount);
  if (isAlignedQuoteToken) {
    const takerScaleIfAlignedQuoteToken = isAlignedQuoteToken
      ? (1 - deployerShare) * 0.8 + deployerShare
      : 1;
    takerPercentage *= takerScaleIfAlignedQuoteToken;
  }

  return { makerPercentage, takerPercentage };
}
```


# Sub-accounts

Up to 10 sub-accounts can be created after reaching $100,000 in volume. Every additional $100M in volume enables the ability to create 1 additional sub-account, up to a maximum of 50 sub-accounts.&#x20;

Sub-accounts share the same fee tiers as the master account, but referral discounts do not apply to sub-accounts.&#x20;

The number of API wallets available starts at 3 for all master accounts and increases by 2 per sub-account. Refer to the [API Docs](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/exchange-endpoint#subaccounts-and-vaults) for trading via sub-account.&#x20;


# Builder codes

*Note: The term "builder" in the context of builder codes does not refer to block builders within consensus, but rather "defi builders" who build applications on Hyperliquid.*

**Builder codes** allow builders to receive a fee on fills that they send on behalf of a user. They are set per-order for maximal flexibility. The user must approve a maximum builder fee for each builder, and can revoke permissions at any time. Builder codes are processed entirely onchain as part of the fee logic.

In order to use builder codes, the end user would first approve a max fee for the builder address via the `ApproveBuilderFee` action. This action must be signed by the user's main wallet, not an agent/API wallet. The builder must have at least 100 USDC in perps account value and must use standard as the account abstraction mode.

Builder codes currently only apply to fees that are collected in the quote or collateral asset. In other words, builder codes do not apply to the buying side of spot trades but apply to both sides of perp trades. Builder fees charged can be at most 0.1% on perps and 1% on spot.

Once the authorization is complete, future order actions sent on behalf of the user may include an optional builder parameter: `{"b": address, "f": number}`. `b` is the address of the builder and `f` is the builder fee to charge in tenths of basis points. I.e. a value of 10 means 1 basis point.&#x20;

Builders can claim fees from builder codes through the usual referral reward claim process.

Each user can have a maximum of 10 active builder code approvals at a time.

For example code see the Python SDK <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/basic_builder_fee.py>

### API for builders

The approved maximum builder fee for a user can be queried via an info request `{"type": "maxBuilderFee", "user": "0x...", "builder": "0x..."}.`

The total builder fees collected for a builder is part of the referral state response from info request `{"type": "referral", "user": "0x..."}`.

The trades that use a particular builder code are uploaded in compressed LZ4 format to `https://stats-data.hyperliquid.xyz/Mainnet/builder_fills/{builder_address}/{YYYYMMDD}.csv.lz4`e.g. `https://stats-data.hyperliquid.xyz/Mainnet/builder_fills/0x123.../20241031.csv.lz4`&#x20;

Important: Note that these URLs are case sensitive, and require that `builder_address`be entirely lowercase.&#x20;


# Perpetual assets

Hyperliquid currently supports trading of 100+ assets. Assets are added according to community input. Ultimately Hyperliquid will feature a decentralized and permissionless listing process.&#x20;

Max leverage varies by asset, ranging from 3x to 40x. Maintenance margin is half of the initial margin at max leverage. E.g., if max leverage is 20x, the maintenance margin is 2.5%.


# Contract specifications

### Crypto Perps

Hyperliquid perpetuals are derivatives products without expiration date. Instead, they rely on funding payments to ensure convergence to the underlying spot price over time. See [Funding](/hyperliquid-docs/trading/funding) for more information.&#x20;

Hyperliquid has one main style of margining for perpetual contracts: USDC margining, USDT denominated linear contracts. That is, the oracle price is denominated in USDT, but the collateral is USDC. This allows for the best combination of liquidity and accessibility. Note that no conversions with the USDC/USDT exchange rate are applied, so these contracts are technically quanto contracts where USDT pnl is denominated in USDC.

When the spot asset's primary source of liquidity is USDC denominated, the oracle price is denominated in USDC. Currently, the only USDC-denominated perpetual contracts are PURR-USD and HYPE-USD, where the most liquid spot oracle source is Hyperliquid spot.

Hyperliquid's contract specifications are simpler than most platforms. There are few contract-specific details and no address-specific restrictions.

### Recurring outcomes

Recurring outcomes are automatically deployed and settled by the protocol on a fixed cadence. The specification for the current instance of the recurring outcome is found in the `description` field of `outcomeMeta` .

#### Binary&#x20;

```
class:priceBinary|underlying:BTC|expiry:20260503-0600|targetPrice:78213|period:1d"
```

The target price is computed using a linear interpolation between the mark price updates immediately before and immediately after the settlement timestamp. Precisely, the contract settles to YES if and only if `markPrice0 + (settlementTime - t0) / (t1 - t0) * (markPrice1 - markPrice0) ≥ targetPrice` where `t0` and `t1` are the timestamps of mark price updates immediately before and after `settlementTime`

#### Multi-price&#x20;

```
"class:priceBucket|underlying:BTC|expiry:20260507-0745|priceThresholds:81538,81783|period:15m"
```

There are three price buckets depending on the target price at the time of settlement: `< P1`, `[P1, P2)` and `≥ P2.` Exactly one of the 3 outcomes settles to 1, and the others settle to 0. The target price computation uses the same interpolation as binary markets described above.

### Uniqueness

There is guaranteed to be at most one recurring series for each `(seriesType, underlying, period)` combination.


# Margining

Margin computations follow similar formulas to major centralized derivatives exchanges.

### Margin Mode

When opening a position, a margin mode is selected. *Cross margin* is the default, which allows for maximal capital efficiency by sharing collateral between all other cross margin positions. *Isolated margin* is also supported, which allows an asset's collateral to be constrained to that asset. Liquidations in that asset do not affect other isolated positions or cross positions. Similarly, cross liquidations or other isolated liquidations do not affect the original isolated position.&#x20;

Some assets are *strict isolated*, which functions the same as isolated margin with the additional constraint that margin cannot be removed. Margin is proportionally removed as the position is closed.&#x20;

### HIP-3 Margin Modes

When users have perp positions across multiple DEXs, cross margin behaves different depending on the user's account abstraction. For unified account and portfolio margin, the user's cross margin positions in DEXs with the same collateral all share margin. For standard abstraction, cross margin only applies to the assets within the same DEX. See [here](/hyperliquid-docs/trading/account-abstraction-modes) for more details.

HIP-3 DEXs also support "no cross" margin mode, which allows isolated margin with margin removal enabled, but does not allow cross margin.&#x20;

### Initial Margin and Leverage

Leverage can be set by a user to any integer between 1 and the max leverage. Max leverage depends on the asset.&#x20;

The margin required to open a position is `position_size * mark_price / leverage`. The initial margin is used by the position and cannot be withdrawn for cross margin positions. Isolated positions support adding and removing margin after opening the position. Unrealized pnl for cross margin positions will automatically be available as initial margin for new positions, while isolated positions will apply unrealized pnl as additional margin for the open position.\
\
The leverage of an existing position can be increased without closing the position. Leverage is only checked upon opening a position. Afterwards, the user is responsible for monitoring the leverage usage to avoid liquidation. Possible actions to take on positions with negative unrealized pnl include partially or fully closing the position, adding margin (if isolated), and depositing USDC (if cross).

### Unrealized PNL and transfer margin requirements

Unrealized pnl can be withdrawn from isolated positions or cross account, but only if the remaining margin is at least 10% of the total notional position value of all open positions. The margin remaining must also meet the initial margin requirement, i.e. `transfer_margin_required = max(initial_margin_required, 0.1 * total_position_value)`&#x20;

Here, "transferring" includes any action that removes margin from a position, other than trading. Examples include withdrawals, transfer to spot wallet, and isolated margin transfers.

### Maintenance Margin and Liquidations

Cross positions are liquidated when the account value (including unrealized pnl) is less than the *maintenance margin* times the total open notional position. The maintenance margin is currently set to half of the initial margin at max leverage.&#x20;

Isolated positions are liquidated by the same maintenance margin logic, but the only inputs to the computation are the isolated margin and the notional value of the isolated position.


# Account abstraction modes

A user's *account abstraction mode* determines how spot and perps balances interact, and whether various assets are used as collateral for perps trading.&#x20;

The supported modes are:

1. Unified account (recommended for most users): single balance for each asset. This balance collateralizes all cross margin positions in that asset and is unified with spot balance in that asset. For example, USDC balance is the single source for validator-operated perps, XYZ perps, and spot trading against USDC as a quote asset. USDT spot balance is the single source for CASH perps and spot trading against USDT as a quote asset.&#x20;
2. Portfolio margin (most capital efficient): single portfolio unifying all eligible assets, which are currently HYPE, BTC, USDC, USDT. See [Portfolio margin](/hyperliquid-docs/trading/portfolio-margin) for more details.&#x20;
3. Manual / Standard (recommended for market makers, high volume automated users, and deployers/builders): separate perp and spot balances, separate DEX balances. Cross margin applies to each DEX separately.&#x20;

There is one more mode that was discontinued, included here for completeness:

4. DEX abstraction (discontinued): USDC balances default to perps balance, all other collateral defaults to spot balance. IMPORTANT: Cross margin on HIP-3 DEXs does not behave intuitively for DEX abstraction users.&#x20;

Important details:

1. Builder code addresses must be in standard mode to accrue builder fees
2. Portfolio margin and unified account are limited to 50k user actions per day. Standard mode has no such restrictions.
3. For API users, unified account and portfolio margin show all balances and holds in the spot clearinghouse state. Individual perp dex user states are not meaningful. &#x20;

See Python SDK and [API docs](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api) for examples on the agent- and user-signed actions for changing account abstraction modes. &#x20;

### Unified Account Ratio

To compute the precise unified account ratio for monitoring liquidation risk:

```typescript
function computeUnifiedAccountRatio(
    multiverse: Record<string, { index: number; collateralToken: number }>,
    perpDexStates: Array<{
      clearinghouseState: {
        crossMaintenanceMarginUsed: number;
        assetPositions: Array<{
          position: { leverage: { type: string }; marginUsed: number };
        }>;
      };
    }>,
    spotBalances: Array<{ token: number; total: number }>,
  ): number {
    const indexToCollateralToken: Record<number, number> = {};
    for (const meta of Object.values(multiverse)) {
      indexToCollateralToken[meta.index] = meta.collateralToken;
    }

    const crossMarginByToken: Record<number, number> = {};
    const isolatedMarginByToken: Record<number, number> = {};

    for (let index = 0; index < perpDexStates.length; index++) {
      const dex = perpDexStates[index];
      const token = indexToCollateralToken[index];
      if (dex === undefined || token === undefined) continue;

      crossMarginByToken[token] =
        (crossMarginByToken[token] ?? 0) +
        dex.clearinghouseState.crossMaintenanceMarginUsed;

      for (const ap of dex.clearinghouseState.assetPositions) {
        if (ap.position.leverage.type === "isolated") {
          isolatedMarginByToken[token] =
            (isolatedMarginByToken[token] ?? 0) + ap.position.marginUsed;
        }
      }
    }

    let maxRatio = 0;
    for (const [tokenStr, crossMargin] of Object.entries(crossMarginByToken)) {
      const token = Number(tokenStr);
      const spotTotal = spotBalances.find((b) => b.token === token)?.total ?? 0;
      const isolatedMargin = isolatedMarginByToken[token] ?? 0;
      const available = spotTotal - isolatedMargin;

# Portfolio margin

Under portfolio margin, a user’s spot and perps trading are unified for greater capital efficiency. Furthermore, portfolio margin accounts automatically earn yield on all borrowable assets not actively used for trading.

Portfolio margin unlocks functionality such as the carry trade where a spot balance is offset by a short perps position, collateralized by the spot balance. Spot and perp pnl offset each other, protecting against liquidation on the perp position. More generally, spot and perps trading can be performed from a single unified balance. For example, a user could also hold HYPE and immediately buy BTC on the BTC/USDC book. All HIP-3 DEXs are included in portfolio margin, though not all HIP-3 DEX collateral assets are borrowable. Future HyperCore asset classes and primitives will support portfolio margin as well.

Users can supply eligible quote assets to earn yield. This synergizes and composes with HyperEVM lending protocols. In a future upgrade, CoreWriter will expose the same supply action for smart contracts. Portfolio margin intentionally does not bring a full-fledged lending market to HyperCore, as that is best built by independent teams on the EVM. For example, HyperCore lending is not tokenized, but an EVM protocol could do so by launching a fully onchain yield-bearing ERC20 token contract through CoreWriter and precompiles. Portfolio margin introduces organic demand to borrow and should expand the value proposition of teams building on the HyperEVM.

IMPORTANT: Portfolio margin is a complex technical upgrade and requires bootstrapping the supply side for borrowable assets. Portfolio margin accounts will fall back to non-portfolio margin behavior when caps are hit. The following requirements apply:&#x20;

* Master account >$5M in weighted volume or account value >$10k
* Account value <$25M
* USDT: 50M USDT global supply cap, 10M USDT global borrow cap, 5M USDT user supply cap, 1M USDT user borrow cap
* USDC: 1B USDC global supply cap, 500M USDC global borrow cap, 250M USDC user supply cap, 50M USDC user borrow cap
* HYPE: 10M HYPE global supply cap, 1M HYPE user supply cap
* BTC: 2k BTC global supply cap, 200 BTC user supply cap

### LTV and borrowing

Under portfolio margin, eligible collateral assets have an LTV (loan-to-value) ratio between 0 and 1. HYPE and BTC have an LTV of 0.5. When placing spot and perp orders under portfolio margin, insufficient balance will automatically borrowed against eligible collateral up to `token_balance * borrow_oracle_price * ltv` , where price is denominated in the asset being borrowed.

Borrowed assets accrue interest continuously, and are indexed hourly to match the perp funding interval. Portfolio margin users pay interest on borrowed assets and earn interest on idle assets according to the same rate. The borrow interest rate for stablecoins is set at `0.05 + 4.75 * max(0, utilization - 0.8)` APY, compounded continuously depending on the instantaneous value of `utilization = total_borrowed_value / total_supplied_value` . Earned interest is accrued proportionally to all suppliers. The protocol retains 10% of borrowed interest as a buffer for future liquidations.

### Example: Carry trade

The carry trade becomes significantly more capital efficient with portfolio margin, as there is no trading cost to rebalance over signifcant price ranges. A portfolio margin account's spot borrow and perps pnl offset each other for accounting. The trader still needs to account for external factors such as funding, interest, and drift between spot and perp prices.

For example, a user holds 1 BTC in spot and shorts 1 BTC-USDC perp at 10x leverage. If BTC's price is 100k, the user only pays interest on the 1/10 initial margin but earns funding on the full 100k position. If BTC's price moves down to 50k, the trader has unrealized pnl in USDC. The trader can choose to maintain the notional value of the trade by buying more spot BTC and increasing the perp short. If BTC's price moves up to 150k, portfolio margin automatically borrows 50k USDC against the spot BTC, now worth 150k. The user can sell BTC and close the perp position to maintain the notional exposure of the funding trade. If BTC's price moves up to 200k, the trader must reduce the notional exposure of the funding trade to avoid a borrow-lend liquidation.

Note that the hedged price range increased dramatically compared to the same trade without portfolio margin, where the perp leg is collateralized by USDC.  &#x20;

### Liquidations

Portfolio margin is a generalization of cross margin. Instead of margining all perp positions within one DEX together, all cross margin perp positions and spot balances are collectively margined together within one account. Sub-accounts are still treated separately under portfolio margin.&#x20;

Liquidations are triggered when the entire portfolio margin account is below its portfolio maintenance margin requirement. Users can monitor this requirement via the *portfolio margin ratio,* defined as

{% code overflow="wrap" %}

```latex
portfolio_margin_ratio = max_{borrowable_token} (portfolio_maintenance_requirement(borrowable_token) / portfolio_liquidation_value(borrowable_token))

where

portfolio_maintenance_requirement(token) = min_borrow_offset + sum_{dex} cross_maintenance_margin(dex) + borrowed_size_for_maintenance(token) * borrow_oracle_price(token)

portfolio_liquidation_value(token) = portfolio_balance(token) + min(borrow_cap(token), min(portfolio_balance(token), supply_cap(token)) * borrow_oracle_price(token) * liquidation_threshold(token))

liquidation_threshold(token) = 0.5 + 0.5 * LTV(token)

borrow_oracle_price(token) = median(HL_spot_USDC_price, HL_perp_mark_price * USDT_USDC_oracle, HL_perp_oracle_price * USDT_USDC_oracle)

USDT_USDC_oracle = 1 / HL_spot_oracle_price(USDC)

min_borrow_offset = 20 USDC
```

{% endcode %}

The account becomes liquidatable when portfolio\_margin\_ratio > 0.95. All notional values in the above definition are converted to USDC using `borrow_oracle_price(token)` .

After borrow caps are hit, additional margin used must be supplied by the user using the settlement asset regardless of whether portfolio margin is active.&#x20;

Depending on the order of oracle price updates, either perp positions or spot borrows may be liquidated first. In other words, once portfolio margin ratio is liquidatable, users should not expect a deterministic liquidation sequence.

Portfolio margin liquidations are taken over directly by the backstop liquidator at system address `0xbbb...b` . If the user health is below the full liquidation threshold, the supplied assets with positive LTV and borrowed assets are fully taken over by the backstop liquidator. If the user health is between the partial liquidation and full liquidation threshold, supplied assets with positive LTV and borrowed assets are instead taken over in 20% intervals, stopping as soon as the user is no longer liquidatable. The slippage threshold for takeover is `size_liquidated * oracle_price * (LTV(asset) + 2) / 3) * width`  where width is `3M USDC` for HYPE and `300k USDC`  for BTC. The backstop liquidator converts collateral assets to debt assets for repayment, using a TWAP with a half life of 10 minutes. Unlike perps, there is no market liquidation phase, as spot books have less consistent liquidity than perps.


# Margin tiers

Like most centralized exchanges, the tiered leverage formula on Hyperliquid is as follows:

`maintenance_margin = notional_position_value * maintenance_margin_rate - maintenance_deduction`&#x20;

On Hyperliquid, `maintenance_margin_rate` and `maintenance_deduction` depend only on the margin tiers, not the asset.

`maintenance_margin_rate(tier = n) = (Initial Margin Rate at Maximum leverage at tier n) / 2` . For example, at 20x max leverage, `maintenance_margin_rate = 2.5%`.

Maintenance deduction is defined at each tier to account for the different maintenance margin rates used at previous tiers:

`maintenance_deduction(tier = 0) = 0`  &#x20;

`maintenance_deduction(tier = n) = maintenance_deduction(tier = n - 1) + notional_position_lower_bound(tier = n) * (maintenance_margin_rate(tier = n) - maintenance_margin_rate(tier = n - 1))` for `n > 0`&#x20;

In other words, maintenance deduction is defined so that new positions opened at each tier increase maintenance margin at `maintenance_margin_rate` , while having the total maintenance margin be a continuous function of position size.

Margin tables have unique IDs and the tiers can be found in the `meta` Info response. For IDs less than 50, there is a single tier with max leverage equal to the ID.

# Robust price indices

Hyperliquid makes use of several robust prices based on order book and external data to minimize risk of market manipulation.

*Oracle price* is used to compute funding rates. This weighted median of CEX prices is robust because it does not depend on hyperliquid's market data at all. Oracle prices are updated by the validators approximately once every three seconds.

*Mark price* is the median of the following prices:

1. Oracle price plus a 150 second exponential moving average (EMA) of the difference between Hyperliquid's mid price and the oracle price
2. The median of best bid, best ask, last trade on Hyperliquid
3. Median of Binance, OKX, Bybit, Gate IO, MEXC perp mid prices with weights 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, respectively

If exactly two out of the three inputs above exist, the 30 second EMA of the median of best bid, best ask, and last trade on Hyperliquid is also added to the median inputs.

Mark price is an unbiased and robust estimate of the fair perp price, and is used for margining, liquidations, triggering TP/SL, and computing unrealized pnl. Mark price is updated whenever validators publish new oracle prices. Therefore, mark and oracle price are updated approximately once every 3 seconds.

The EMA update formula is defined as follows for an update value of `sample` at duration `t` since the last update

`ema = numerator / denominator`

`numerator -> numerator * exp(-t / 2.5 minutes) + sample * t`&#x20;

`denominator -> denominator * exp(-t / 2.5 minutes) + t`


# Liquidations

### Overview

A liquidation event occurs when a trader's positions move against them to the point where the account equity falls below the maintenance margin. The maintenance margin is half of the initial margin at max leverage, which varies from 3-40x. In other words, the maintenance margin is between 1.25% (for 40x max leverage assets) and 16.7% (for 3x max leverage assets) depending on the asset.

When the account equity drops below maintenance margin, the positions are first attempted to be entirely closed by sending market orders to the book. The orders are for the full size of the position, and may be fully or partially closed. If the positions are entirely or partially closed such that the maintenance margin requirements are met, any remaining collateral remains with the trader.

If the account equity drops below 2/3 of the maintenance margin without successful liquidation through the book, a backstop liquidation happens through the liquidator vault. See Liquidator Vault explanation below for more details.

When a cross position is backstop liquidated, the trader's cross positions and cross margin are all transferred to the liquidator. In particular, if the trader has no isolated positions, the trader ends up with zero account equity.

When an isolated position is backstop liquidated, that isolated position and isolated margin are transferred to the liquidator. The user's cross margin and positions are untouched.

During backstop liquidation, the maintenance margin is not returned to the user. This is because the liquidator vault requires a buffer to make sure backstop liquidations are profitable on average. In order to avoid losing the maintenance margin, traders can place stop loss orders or exit the positions before the mark price reaches the liquidation price.

Liquidations use the mark price, which combines external CEX prices with Hyperliquid's book state. This makes liquidations more robust than using a single instantaneous book price. During times of high volatility or on highly leveraged positions, mark price may be significantly different from book price. It is recommended to use the exact formula for precise monitoring of liquidations.

### Motivation

As described above, the majority of liquidations on Hyperliquid are sent directly to the order book. This allows all users to compete for the liquidation flow, and allows the liquidated user to keep any remaining margin. Unlike CEXs there is no clearance fee on liquidations.&#x20;

The resulting system is transparent and prioritizes retaining as much capital as possible for the liquidated user.

### Partial Liquidations

For liquidatable positions larger than 100k USDC (10k USDC on testnet for easier testing), only 20% of the position will be sent as a market liquidation order to the book. After a block where any position of a user is partially liquidated, there is a cooldown period of 30 seconds. During this cooldown period, all market liquidation orders for that user will be for the entire position.

### Liquidator Vault

Backstop liquidations on Hyperliquid are democratized through the liquidator vault, which is a component strategy of HLP. Positions that are below 2/3 of the maintenance margin can be taken over by the liquidator vault.&#x20;

On average, backstop liquidations are profitable for the liquidator. On most venues, this profit goes to the exchange operator or privileged market makers who internalize the flow. On Hyperliquid, the pnl stream from liquidations go entirely to the community through HLP.&#x20;

### Computing Liquidation Price

When entering a trade, an estimated liquidation price is shown. This estimation may be inaccurate compared to the position's estimated liquidation price due to changing liquidity on the book.

Once a position is opened, a liquidation price is shown. This price has the certainty of the entry price, but still may not be the actual liquidation price due to funding payments or changes in unrealized pnl in other positions (for cross margin positions).

The actual liquidation price is independent on the leverage set for cross margin positions. A cross margin position at lower leverage simply uses more collateral.

The liquidation price does depend on leverage set for isolated margin positions, because the amount of isolated margin allocated depends on the initial margin set.

When there is insufficient margin to make the trade, the liquidation price estimate assumes that the account is topped up to the initial margin requirement.&#x20;

The precise formula for the liquidation price of a position is

`liq_price = price - side * margin_available / position_size / (1 - l * side)`

where

`l = 1 / MAINTENANCE_LEVERAGE` . For assets with margin tiers, maintenance leverage depends on the unique margin tier corresponding to the position value at the liquidation price.

`side = 1 for long and -1 for short`

`margin_available (cross) = account_value - maintenance_margin_required`

`margin_available (isolated) = isolated_margin - maintenance_margin_required`


# Auto-deleveraging

Auto-deleveraging strictly ensures that the platform stays solvent. If a user's account value or isolated position value becomes negative, the users on the opposite side of the position are ranked by unrealized pnl and leverage used. Backstop liquidated positions have no special treatment in the ADL queue logic. The specific sorting index to determine the affected users in profit is `(mark_price / entry_price) * (notional_position / account_value)`. Those traders' positions are closed at the previous mark price against the now underwater user, ensuring that the platform has no bad debt. &#x20;

Auto-deleveraging is an important final safeguard on the solvency of the platform. There is a strict invariant that under all operations, a user who has no open positions will not socialize any losses of the platform.


# Funding

### Overview

Funding rates for crypto perpetual contracts are a mechanism that is used to ensure the price of the contract stays close to the underlying asset's price.&#x20;

The funding rate is a periodic fee that is paid by one side of the contract (either long or short) to the other side. Funding is purely peer-to-peer and no fees are collected on the payments.

The rate is calculated based on the difference between the contract's price and the spot price of the underlying asset. For consistency with CEXs, interest rate component is predetermined at 0.01% every 8 hours, which is 0.00125% every hour, or 11.6% APR paid to short. This represents the difference in cost to borrow USD versus spot crypto.&#x20;

The premium component fluctuates based on the difference between the perpetual contract's price and the underlying spot oracle price. If the contract's price is higher than the oracle price, the premium and hence the funding rate will be positive, and the long position will pay the short position. Conversely, if the contract's price is lower than the spot price, the funding rate will be negative, and the short position will pay the long position.

The funding rate on Hyperliquid is paid every hour. The funding rate is added or subtracted from the balance of contract holders at the funding interval.

Funding rates are designed to prevent large price disparities between the perpetual contract and the underlying asset. When the funding rate is high, it can incentivize traders to take the opposite position and help to bring the contract's price closer to the spot price of the underlying asset.

### Technical details

Funding on Hyperliquid is designed to closely match the process used by centralized perpetual exchanges.&#x20;

The funding rate formula applies to 8 hour funding rate. However, funding is paid every hour at one eighth of the computed rate for each hour.

The specific formula is `Funding Rate (F) = Average Premium Index (P) + clamp (interest rate - Premium Index (P), -0.0005, 0.0005)`. The premium is sampled every 5 seconds and averaged over the hour.

As described in the [clearinghouse](/hyperliquid-docs/hypercore/clearinghouse) section, the oracle prices are computed by each validator as the weighted median of CEX spot prices for each asset, with weights depending on the liquidity of the CEX.&#x20;

`premium = impact_price_difference / oracle_price`&#x20;

where&#x20;

`impact_price_difference = max(impact_bid_px - oracle_px, 0) - max(oracle_px - impact_ask_px, 0)` .

and `impact_bid_px` and `impact_ask_px` are the average execution prices to trade`impact_notional_usd` on the bid and ask sides, respectively. See the contract specifications for the impact notional used, as well as other contract specific parameters.

For HIP-3 perps, a more responsive premium formula is used to allow deployers to express a larger range of funding behaviors using the funding rate multiplier and interest rate:

`premium = (0.5 * (impact_bid_px + impact_ask_px) / oracle_px) - 1` .

Funding on Hyperliquid is capped at 4%/hour. Note that this is much less aggressive capping than CEX counterparts. The funding cap and funding interval do not depend on the asset.&#x20;

Note that the funding payment at the end of the interval is `position_size * oracle_price * funding_rate`. In particular, the spot oracle price is used to convert the position size to notional value, *not the mark price.*

### Numerical Example

Here is an explicit example computation:

1. The interest rate is 0.01% (fixed).
2. The perpetual contract is trading at a premium, with the impact bid price being $10,100, and the spot price at $10,000.
3. The premium index is calculated as the difference between the two prices, which is $100 in this case.
4. The funding interval is 1 hour.
5. You hold a long position of 10 contracts, each representing 1 BTC.

First, calculate the premium:

Premium = (Impact bid price - Spot Price) / Spot Price = ($10,100 - $10,000) / $10,000 Premium = 0.01 (or 1%)

Next, clamp the interest rate minus the premium rate at 0.05%:

Clamped Difference = min(max(Interest Rate - Premium Rate, -0.05%), 0.05%)&#x20;

Clamped Difference = min(max(0.01% - 1%, -0.05%), 0.05%)&#x20;

Clamped Difference = min(max(-0.99%, -0.05%), 0.05%) Clamped Difference = -0.05%

Now, calculate the funding rate:

Funding Rate = Premium Rate + Clamped Difference Funding Rate = 1% + (-0.05%)&#x20;

Funding Rate = 0.95%


# Order book

The order book works in essentially the same way as all centralized exchanges but is fully on-chain. Orders are added where price is an integer multiple of the tick size, and size is an integer multiple of lot size. The orders are matched in price-time priority.&#x20;

See this[ ](/hyperliquid-docs/hypercore/order-book)[section](/hyperliquid-docs/hypercore/order-book) for further details on order book implementation.


# Order types

### Order types:

* Market: An order that executes immediately at the current market price
* Limit: An order that executes at the selected limit price or better
* Chase: A Post Only (ALO) limit order that automatically re-prices to track the best bid or ask until it is filled or terminated. The order rests one tick above the best bid (for buys) or one tick below the best ask (for sells), or at the best bid/ask when the spread is a single tick. Chase orders run in the browser tab where they are created, and up to 5 can be active at once
* Stop Market: A market order that is activated when the price reaches the selected trigger price. For long orders, the trigger price needs to be higher than the mid price. For short orders, the trigger price needs to be lower than the mid price
* Stop Limit: A limit order that is activated when the price reaches the selected trigger price
* Take Market:  A market order that is activated when the price reaches the selected trigger price. For long orders, the trigger price needs to be lower than the mid price. For short orders, the trigger price needs to be higher than the mid price
* Take Limit: A limit order that is activated when the price reaches the selected trigger price
* Scale: Multiple limit orders in a set price range &#x20;
* TWAP: A large order divided into smaller suborders and executed at regular intervals, based on order size and running time inputs. Intervals are a minimum of 30 seconds. TWAP suborders have a maximum slippage of 3%
  * Randomize: If enabled, the size of each sub-order will be adjusted randomly up to ±20% of the original trade size
  * Trigger Price: The TWAP order will be activated when the mark price reaches the trigger price set
  * Max/Min Price: The TWAP order will be terminated when the mark price reaches the stop price set

### TWAP details:&#x20;

During execution, a TWAP order attempts to meet an execution target which is defined as the elapsed time divided by the total time times the total size. Suborders are sent at a fixed interval, calculated from the total size and running time inputs. Larger orders over shorter durations are split into suborders sent as often as every 30 seconds; smaller orders over longer durations are split into suborders spaced further apart. Running time can be set from 5 minutes to 7 days, with a $100 minimum total order size.\
\
Example:

* A $10,000 order over 1 hour is split into \~121 suborders of \~$83, sent every 30 seconds
* A $10,000 order over 4 days is split into \~1,000 suborders of \~$10, sent roughly every 6 minutes

A suborder is constrained to have a max slippage of 3%. When suborders do not fully fill because of market conditions (e.g., wide spread, low liquidity, etc.), the TWAP may fall behind its execution target. In this case, the TWAP will try to catch up to this execution target during later suborders. These later suborders will be larger but subject to the constraint of 3 times the normal suborder size (defined as total TWAP size divided by number of suborders). It is possible that if too many suborders did not fill then the TWAP order may not fully catch up to the total size by the end. Like normal market orders, TWAP suborders do not fill during the post-only period of a network upgrade.

### Order options:

* Reduce Only: An order that reduces a current position as opposed to opening a new position in the opposite direction&#x20;
* Good Til Cancel (GTC): An order that rests on the order book until it is filled or canceled&#x20;
* Post Only (ALO): An order that is added to the order book but doesn’t execute immediately. It is only executed as a resting order
* Immediate or Cancel (IOC): An order that will be canceled if it is not immediately filled
* Take Profit: An order that triggers when the Take Profit (TP) price is reached.
* Stop Loss: An order that triggers when the Stop Loss (SL) price is reached
* TP and SL orders are often used by traders to set targets and protect profits or minimize losses on positions. TP and SL are automatically market orders. You can set a limit price and configure the amount of the position to have a TP or SL


# Take profit and stop loss orders (TP/SL)

TP/SL orders close your position when a certain profit (resp. loss) has realized on your position.

The [mark price](/hyperliquid-docs/trading/robust-price-indices) is used to trigger TP/SL orders.&#x20;

TP/SL orders can be dragged on the TradingView chart. Note that dragging in a way that causes the order to immediately execute will lead to an error. Usually this prevents user mistakes, but if this is your desired behavior you can manually close the order from the position table or order form.&#x20;

### Limit vs Market TP/SL orders

Users can choose between TP/SL market and limit orders. TP/SL market orders have a slippage tolerance of 10%.

By setting the limit price on TP/SL orders, users can control the slippage tolerance of a triggered order. The more aggressive the limit price, the more likely the TP/SL order will be filled upon triggering, but the higher the potential slippage upon filling.&#x20;

As a concrete example, a SL order to close a long with trigger price $10 and limit price $10 will hit the book when the mark price drops below $10. If the price drops from $11 to $9 instantly it is quite likely this SL order would rest at $10 instead of filling. However, if the limit price were $8 instead of $10, it's likely to fill at some price between $9 and $8.&#x20;

### TP/SL associated with a position

TP/SL opened from the position form will have a size equal to the entire position by default. These orders will attempt to close the entire position at the time of trigger. If a specific size is configured on these TP/SL orders, they will be fixed-sized (i.e. they will not resize with the position after being placed).

### TP/SL associated with a parent order (a.k.a one-cancels-other, OCO)&#x20;

This style of TP/SL is more complicated. Read the below carefully to avoid unexpected outcomes.

TP/SL opened from the order form have a fixed size equal to the order they are tied to.

If the parent order is fully filled at placement, the children TP and/or SL orders are immediately placed. This behavior is similar to the TP/SL assocated with a position.

When the parent order is not fully filled, the children orders enter an untriggered state. The TP/SL orders have not been placed, and upon cancelation of an unfilled parent order, the child TP/SL orders will be canceled.

If the trader cancels a partially filled parent order, ***the child TP/SL orders are fully canceled as well***. If the trader desires a TP/SL for the partially filled size, they must do so manually, e.g. by placing a separate TP/SL orders associated with the new position.

However, if the parent order is partially filled and then canceled due to insufficient margin, the TP/SL orders will be placed as if the order were fully filled.&#x20;

In conclusion, ***children TP/SL orders associated with a parent order will be placed if and only if the parent order fully fills or is partially filled followed by a cancelation for insufficient margin***.  &#x20;


# Entry price and pnl

On the Hyperliquid DEX, entry price, unrealized pnl, and closed pnl are purely frontend components provided for user convenience. The fundamental accounting is based on margin (balance for spot) and trades.&#x20;

### Perps

Perp trades are considered `opening` when the absolute value of the position increases. In other words, longing when already long or shorting when already short.

For opening trades, the entry price is updated to an average of current entry price and trade price weighted by size.

For closing trades, the entry price is kept the same.

Unrealized pnl is defined as `side * (mark_price - entry_price) * position_size` where `side = 1` for a long position and `side = -1` for a short position

Closed pnl is `fee + side * (mark_price - entry_price) * position_size` for a closing trade and only the fee for an opening trade.

### Spot

Spot trades use the same formulas as perps with the following modifications: Spot trades are considered `opening` for buys and `closing` for sells. Transfers are treated as buys or sells at mark price, and genesis distributions are treated as having entry price at `10000 USDC` market cap. Note that while 0 is the correct answer as genesis distributions are not bought, it leads to undefined return on equity.&#x20;

Pre-existing spot balances are assigned an entry price equal to the first trade or send after the feature was enabled around July 3 08:00 UTC.


# Self-trade prevention

Trades between the same address cancel the resting order instead of causing a fill. No fees are deducted, nor does the the cancel show up in the trade feed.

On CEXs this behavior is often labeled as "expire maker." This is a commonly preferred behavior for market making algorithms, where the aggressing order would like to continue getting fills against liquidity behind the maker order up until the limit price.


# Index perpetual contracts

Index contracts track a formula instead of a spot asset price as the underlying index, but otherwise function exactly the same as normal perpetual contracts.

Instead of tracking the median price across a set of liquid CEXs, index perpetual contracts require the validators to periodically publish the value of the index formula to the Hyperliquid L1. The median of these reported values are then used in place of the spot oracle formula to compute funding rates.

### **NFTI-USD**

`NFTI-USD` is an index of blue-chip NFT collections, including Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Azuki, DeGods, Pudgy Penguins, and Milady Maker.&#x20;

The index is a 3-minute EMA of the aggregate floor price. The aggregate floor price is sum of the floor price of each collection, with BAYC divided by 10. Floor prices are computed by aggregating OpenSea and Blur. CryptoPunks were not included because they predate the NFT standard and are not listed on these marketplaces.&#x20;

Floor prices are converted to USDT using the ETH-USDT spot oracle price

`Index = 3 minute ema of [(BAYC floor price / 10) + (MAYC floor price) + (Azuki floor price) + (DeGods floor price) + (Pudgy Penguins floor price) + (Milady Maker floor price)] / 10000` &#x20;

### FRIEND-USD

`FRIEND-USD` is the first index perpetual contract listed by Hyperliquid.&#x20;

Previously based on community feedback, the top 20 friendtech index rebalanced biweekly. The top subjects were announced by EOD Monday UTC every other week, and the rebalance occured at 14:30 UTC on Wednesday every other week. The scale factor was set at time of rebalance so that the perp index value has a continuous change between old and new index definitions. The criterion for choosing subjects is top 20 subjects by price, 5k twitter followers, and filtering out outliers in trading activity and number of holders. If the community detects manipulation in a pending index change, the criterion may be adjusted accordingly.

Beginning October 4, the`FRIEND-USD`index will track the average one-share buy price of the middle 8 subjects of the following 20 accounts: 0xCaptainLevi, Dingalingts, 0xRacerAlt, HsakaTrades, HerroCrypto, HanweChang, Christianeth, 0xLawliette, CL207, Cryptoyieldinfo, CapitalGrug, iloveponzi, cobie, sayinshallah, pokeepandaa, pranksy, VentureCoinist, 0xBreadguy, saliencexbt, blknoiz06.

From September 13-October 4, the `FRIEND-USD` index tracked the following accounts: 0xRacerAlt, HsakaTrades, 0xCaptainLevi, HerroCrypto, cobie, CL207, 0xLawliette, blknoiz06, 0xSisyphus, Christianeth, Banks, Cryptoyieldinfo, lBattleRhino, CapitalGrug, saliencexbt, zhusu, basedkarbon, RookieXBT, xcurveth, Pancakesbrah. From September 13-20, the median price of the above 20 subjects was used instead of the average one-share buy price of the middle 8 subjects. The median price was scaled by `0.002469` to ensure a continuous transition from the previous index oracle (dated August 23-September 13).

From August 23-September 13, the `FRIEND-USD` index tracked: ‘cobie’, ‘HsakaTrades’, ‘0xRacerAlt’, ‘Banks’, ‘zhusu’, ‘0xSisyphus’, ‘blknoiz06’, ‘RookieXBT’, ‘gainzy222’, ‘xcurveth’, ‘inversebrah’, ‘shrimppepe’, ‘0xLawliette’, ‘dingalingts’, ‘BigDickBull69’, ‘zachxbt’, ‘izebel\_eth’, ‘loomdart’, ‘icebergy\_’, and ‘saliencexbt’. The median price is scaled by `0.00431` to ensure a continuous transition from the previous TVL oracle.

The contract from which the index is derived can be found here: <https://basescan.org/address/0xcf205808ed36593aa40a44f10c7f7c2f67d4a4d4>.

Friendtech key prices are converted to USDT prices based on the robust CEX median ETH/USDT mid price.


# Uniswap perpetuals

Some perpetual contracts on Hyperliquid use Uniswap V2 or V3 AMM price as the underlying spot asset. These contracts are restricted to be isolated-only, which means that cross margin is not allowed and margin cannot be manually removed from an open position. Instead, the position must be partially or fully closed to partially or fully return isolated margin.

Uniswap pool prices are always converted to USDT prices based on the robust CEX oracle prices.

The current contract addresses for the Uniswap pools used as oracles:

RLB: `0x510100d5143e011db24e2aa38abe85d73d5b2177`


# Hyperps

### High level summary

*Hyperps* (Hyperliquid-only perps) trade like vanilla perpetual contracts, but do not require an underlying spot or index oracle price. Instead, the funding rate is determined relative to a moving average hyperp mark price in place of the usual spot price. This makes the hyperp price more stable and less susceptible to manipulation, unlike usual pre-launch futures.&#x20;

This new derivative design does not require an underlying asset or index that exists at all points of the hyperp's lifetime, only that the underlying asset or index eventually exists for settlement or conversion.&#x20;

When trading hyperps, funding rates are very important to consider. If there is heavy price momentum in one direction, funding will heavily incentivize positions in the opposite direction for the next eight hours. As always, be sure to understand the contract before trading.

### Conversion to vanilla perps

For a hyperp tracking ABC, shortly after when ABC/USDT is listed on Binance, OKX, or Bybit spot trading, ABC-USD will convert to a normal ABC-USD perp.

### Hyperp mechanism details

Hyperps work just like normal perpetual contracts, except the external spot/index oracle price is replaced with an 8 hour exponentially weighted moving average of the last day's minutely mark prices.&#x20;

Precisely, `oracle_price(t) = min[sum_{i=0}^1439 [(t - i minutes < t_list ? initial_mark_price : mark_price(t - i minutes)) * exp(-i/480)] * (1 - exp(-1/480)) / (1 - exp(-3)), intial_mark_price * 4]`

Here `a ? b : c` evaluates to `b` if `a` is true and otherwise `c.`

Samples are taken on the first block after each unix minute, but the timestamps used are the nearest exact minute multiples. When there are fewer than 480 mark price samples, the initial mark price is used as the padding value.

Funding rate premium samples are computed as 1% of the usual clamped interest rate and premium formula. See Funding docs for more details.

The mark price of Hyperps incorporate the weighted median of pre-launch perp prices from CEXs as a component in the usual mark price formula. Despite the often significantly different contract specifications between hyperps and other venues' pre-launch perp markets, they are nonetheless included as mark price inputs to provide greater mark price stability during volatility.&#x20;

The mark price of hyperps are capped at 3x the 8-hour mark price EMA. Hyperps with external prelaunch perp listings have mark price capped to 1.5x the median external perp price (the third component of the mark price). The oracle price is also restricted to be at most 4 times the one month average mark price as an additional safeguard against manipulation.


# Delisting

Validators vote on whether to delist validator-operated perps. If validators vote to delist an asset, the perps will settle to the 1 hour time weighted spot oracle price before the scheduled delisting voting time. This is a settlement mechanism used by many centralized exchanges.&#x20;

When an asset is delisted, all positions are settled and open orders are cancelled. Users who wish to avoid automatic settlement should close their positions beforehand. After settlement, no new orders will be accepted.


# Market making

There is no DMM program, special rebates / fees, or latency advantages. You can find the Python SDK here: <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk\\>
\
If you have technical integration questions, it's recommended to start in the Discord channel for #api-traders: <https://discord.gg/hyperliquid>


# Portfolio graphs

The portfolio page shows account value and P\&L graphs on 24 hour, 7 day, and 30 day time horizons.&#x20;

`Account value` includes unrealized pnl from cross and isolated margin positions, as well as vault balances.&#x20;

Pnl is defined as `account value` plus net deposits, i.e. `account value + deposits - withdrawals`.

Note that these graphs are samples on deposits and withdrawals and also every 15 minutes. Therefore, they are not recommended to precise accounting purposes, as the interpolation between samples may not reflect the actual change in unrealized pnl in between two consecutive samples.


# Miscellaneous UI

### Max Drawdown

The max drawdown on the portfolio page is only used on the frontend for users' convenience. It does not affect any margining or computations on Hyperliquid. Users who care about the precise formula can get their account value and pnl history and compute it however they choose.

The formula used on the frontend is the maximum over times `end > start` of the value `(pnl(end) - pnl(start)) / account_value(start)`&#x20;

Note that the denominator is account value and the numerator is pnl. Also note that this not equal to absolute max drawdown divided by some account value. Each possible time range considered uses its own denominator.&#x20;


# Validators


# Running a validator

GitHub repository for detailed instructions on how to run a non-validator and validator: <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/node>

Running validating and non-validating nodes is permissionless, meaning anyone can choose to do so. The active set of validators is determined transparently based on the top twenty-seven by stake.


# Delegation program

### Overview

Validators play a critical role in maintaining the integrity and efficiency of Hyperliquid. The Hyper Foundation Delegation Program is designed to:&#x20;

* Enhance network security by delegating tokens to reliable and high-performing validators.
* Promote diversity across the validator network to enhance decentralization.
* Support validators committed to the growth and stability of the Hyperliquid ecosystem.

Testnet performance will be a criterion for mainnet delegation, particularly when mainnet performance metrics are not available for a given validator. Delegations will be monitored on an ongoing basis. The Foundation reserves the right to cease delegation at any time.

The Foundation validators will strongly consider participation in the Delegation Program as a factor for trusting peer validators. Those interested in running a mainnet validator are highly encouraged to apply for the Delegation Program before setting up a mainnet validator.

### Eligibility

* You must have 10k HYPE in one address before applying. The minimum self-delegation amount is 10k HYPE. Note that the minimum self-delegation amount is locked for one year.
* You must run at least two non-validator nodes with 95% uptime if your application is accepted. The IP addresses of these nodes will be shared publicly and attributed to you on documentation pages. Others will use your non-validators as seed nodes to connect to. The IP addresses must be static, e.g. using elastic IP addresses on AWS. Important: Do not open any non-validator ports to the public until an announcement to open up mainnet non-validators. Never open validator ports to the public.
* You must comply with applicable laws and regulations.&#x20;
* You must successfully complete KYC/KYB processes.&#x20;
* You must not be from a restricted jurisdiction, which includes, but is not limited to, Ontario, the U.S., Cuba, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Syria, and certain Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine.&#x20;
* The Foundation reserves the right to adjust the above eligibility criteria at any time.

### Apply

* Fill out the [application form](https://forms.gle/Mheitp58BkjU1qK8A).
* Following review of your application, you may be invited to provide KYC/KYB details.
* If your application is accepted and KYC/KYB is completed, you will need to review and accept the Program Terms.


# Referrals

### How do I refer someone to Hyperliquid?

You can create a referral code on <https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/referrals> after you’ve done $10,000 in volume. You will receive 10% of referred users' fees, less any fee discount they receive. Referral rewards apply for a user's first $1B in volume and referral discounts apply for a user's first $25M in volume.&#x20;

Share your referral code with other traders using a unique link: app.hyperliquid.xyz/join/YOURCODE.&#x20;

Referral rewards accrue for all quote assets and can be claimed once >$1. Claimed referral rewards are reflected in your spot balance. &#x20;

### How do I use a referral code?

Enter a referral code on <https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/referrals> or use a friend's referral link. Using a referral code will give you a 4% discount on your fees for your first $25M in volume. Referral discounts do not apply to vaults or sub-accounts because those are treated as independent accounts in the clearinghouse.


# Proposal: Staking referral program

*At this time, there is no definitive implementation for the staking referral program ready for mainnet. Based on extensive user and builder feedback, it is being re-evaluated to ensure fairness for all builders and a healthy builder ecosystem.*&#x20;

Details for the original proposal for a staking referral program are below:&#x20;

Builders and referrers who stake HYPE will be able to keep a percentage of their referred users’ trading fees, up to a maximum of 40% for builders and referrers at the highest staking tier. All builders and referrers with staked HYPE will automatically enjoy these benefits once the feature is enabled on mainnet.

Furthermore, builders and referrers will be able to share up to 50% of the staking referral revenue back to the referred user. This allows referrers to offer better than the default rates to new users.

### What are builder codes and referral codes?&#x20;

Builder codes allow interfaces routing through Hyperliquid to charge a custom fee on a per-order basis. This additional fee is called a builder fee and goes 100% to the builder. The new staking referral program is strictly more revenue for builders.

Referral codes are applied when a user joins via a referral link. Unlike builder codes, referral codes are tied to users and apply regardless of how the user trades in perpetuity. Note that builder codes override referral codes for that order, and referral codes are disabled after the user trades $1B cumulative volume.&#x20;

### How it works

The staking referral program interacts with staking tier fee discounts and the VIP tier fee schedule. If a builder or referrer has a higher staking tier than their referred user on a trade, they keep up to 100% of the difference. The percentage kept by the builder or referrer decreases as the volume tier of the referred user increases, starting at 100% for VIP 0 and ending at 40% for VIP 6.&#x20;

As an example: Alice has 100k staked HYPE, which gives a trading fee discount of 30%. Bob has 100 staked HYPE, which gives a trading fee discount of 10%, and Bob is at VIP 1. If Bob uses Alice’s builder or referral code, Alice can keep (30% - 10%) \* 90% = 18% of the fees that Bob pays. Alice could share with Bob up to 9% of his fees. In other words, Bob could receive up to a 9% trading fee discount using Alice’s builder or referral code.&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="140.3671875">VIP tier</th><th width="208.53515625">14d weighted volume ($)</th><th width="265.47265625">Amount kept by builder or referrer</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td></td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>>5M</td><td>90%</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>>25M</td><td>80%</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>>100M</td><td>70%</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>>500M</td><td>60%</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>>2B</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>>7B</td><td>40%</td></tr></tbody></table>

*Note these tiers correspond to the fee schedules in* [Fees](/hyperliquid-docs/trading/fees)


# Points

The points program began on November 1, 2023. 1,000,000 points were distributed weekly to users for 6 months, ending May 1, 2024. Points are meant to reward users who contribute to the protocol’s success.

Affiliates earned 1 point for every 4 points their referred users earned. Points criteria was updated on a recurring basis. Points distributions were based on weekly activity ending Wednesdays at 00:00 UTC. Distributions took place on Thursdays. Points were also distributed for the closed alpha period up through October 31, 2023.

The L1 phase of points began on May 29, 2024 and ended in November 2024. 700,000 points were distributed weekly. Activity from May 1-28, 2024 received a multiplier. Hyperliquid reserves the right to modify previous point distributions under its sole discretion.


# Historical data

### Exporting additional user trade history

The Enigma team has built an interface for users to export trade history <https://trade-export.hypedexer.com/?v=1>. This is a third-party integration that is independently maintained. Any issues or feedback should be reported directly to the maintainers.&#x20;

### Market Data (for advanced users)

The examples below use the AWS CLI (see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html>) and LZ4 (<https://github.com/lz4/lz4> or install from your package manager).

Note that the requester of the data must pay for transfer costs.

#### Asset data

Historical data is uploaded to the bucket `hyperliquid-archive`  approximately once a month. **There is no guarantee of timely updates and data may be missing.**&#x20;

L2 book snapshots are available in market\_data and asset contexts are available in asset\_ctxs. No other historical data sets are provided via S3 (e.g. candles or spot asset data). You can use the API to record additional historical data sets yourself.&#x20;

# Asset IDs

Asset IDs are the integer representation for sending orders and cancels via actions. See [here](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/exchange-endpoint) for more details.

### Perps

Perpetual endpoints expect an integer for `asset`, which is the index of the coin found in the `meta` info response. E.g. `BTC = 0` on mainnet.

Builder-deployed perps expect `100000 + perp_dex_index * 10000 + index_in_meta` . For example, `test:ABC` on testnet has `perp_dex_index = 1` ,`index_in_meta = 0` , `asset = 110000` . Note that builder-deployed perps always have name in the format `{dex}:{coin}` .

### Spot

Spot endpoints expect `10000 + spotInfo["index"]` where `spotInfo` is the corresponding object in `spotMeta` that has the desired quote and base tokens. For example, when submitting an order for `PURR/USDC`, the asset that should be used is `10000` because its asset index in the spot info is `0`.

Note that spot ID is different from token ID, and that mainnet and testnet have different asset IDs. For example, for HYPE:

Mainnet token ID: 150

Mainnet spot ID: 107

Testnet token ID: 1105

Testnet spot ID: 1035

### Outcomes

Outcomes share most implementation details with spot trading, with a different token representing each outcome side. However, the API representation of outcomes is different from both spot and perps.

Outcome assets are derived from an `outcome` id plus a binary `side`. These are found in the `outcomeMeta` info response.

For an outcome with id `outcome` and side `side`:

```
encoding = 10 * outcome + side
```

Only side `0` and side `1` are valid.

Example:

* outcome `1`, side `0` -> encoding `10`

The same `encoding` is used in three different representations:

* Outcome spot coin: `#<encoding>`
* Outcome token name: `+<encoding>`
* Outcome asset ID: `100_000_000 + encoding`

Example:

* `#10` = outcome `1`, side `0`
* `+10` = the corresponding token name
* `100000010` = asset ID


# Tick and lot size

Both Price (px) and Size (sz) have a maximum number of decimals that are accepted.&#x20;

Prices can have up to 5 significant figures, but no more than `MAX_DECIMALS - szDecimals` decimal places where `MAX_DECIMALS` is 6 for perps and 8 for spot. Integer prices are always allowed, regardless of the number of significant figures. E.g. `123456` is a valid price even though `12345.6` is not.

Sizes are rounded to the `szDecimals` of that asset. For example, if `szDecimals = 3` then `1.001` is a valid size but `1.0001` is not.&#x20;

`szDecimals` for an asset is found in the meta response to the info endpoint

### Perp price examples

`1234.5` is valid but `1234.56` is not (too many significant figures)

`0.001234` is valid, but `0.0012345` is not (more than 6 decimal places)

If `szDecimals = 1` , `0.01234` is valid but `0.012345` is not (more than `6 - szDecimals` decimal places)

### Spot price examples

`0.0001234` is valid if `szDecimals` is 0 or 1, but not if `szDecimals` is greater than 2 (more than 8-2 decimal places).&#x20;

### Signing

Note that if implementing signing, trailing zeroes should be removed. See [Signing](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/signing) for more details.


# Nonces and API wallets

### Background&#x20;

A decentralized L1 must prevent replay attacks. When a user signs a USDC transfer transaction, the receiver cannot broadcast it multiple times to drain the sender's wallet. To solve this Ethereum stores a "nonce" for each address, which is a number that starts at 0. Each transaction must use exactly "nonce + 1" to be included.

### API wallets

These are also known as `agent wallets` in the docs. A master account can approve API wallets to sign on behalf of the master account or any of the sub-accounts.&#x20;

Note that API wallets are only used to sign. To query the account data associated with a master or sub-account, you must pass in the actual address of that account. A common pitfall is to use the agent wallet which leads to an empty result.

### API wallet pruning

API wallets and their associated nonce state may be pruned in the following cases:

1. The wallet is deregistered. This happens to an existing unnamed API Wallet when an ApproveAgent action is sent to register a new unnamed API Wallet. This also happens to an existing named API Wallet when an ApproveAgent action is sent with a matching name.
2. The wallet expires.
3. The account that registered the agent no longer has funds.

**Important:** for those using API wallets programmatically, it is **strongly** suggested to not reuse their addresses. Once an agent is deregistered, its used nonce state may be pruned. Generate a new agent wallet on future use to avoid unexpected behavior. For example, previously signed actions can be replayed once the nonce set is pruned.

### Hyperliquid nonces&#x20;

Ethereum's design does not work for an onchain order book. A market making strategy can send thousands of orders and cancels in a second. Requiring a precise ordering of inclusion on the blockchain will break any strategy.

On Hyperliquid, the 100 highest nonces are stored per address. Every new transaction must have nonce larger than the smallest nonce in this set and also never have been used before. Nonces are tracked per signer, which is the user address if signed with private key of the address, or the agent address if signed with an API wallet.&#x20;

Nonces must be within `(T - 2 days, T + 1 day)`, where `T` is the unix millisecond timestamp on the block of the transaction.

The following steps may help port over an automated strategy from a centralized exchange:

1. Use a API wallet per trading process. Note that nonces are stored per signer (i.e. private key), so separate subaccounts signed by the same API wallet will share the nonce tracker of the API wallet. It's recommended to use separate API wallets for different subaccounts.
2. In each trading process, have a task that periodically batches order and cancel requests every 0.1 seconds. It is recommended to batch IOC and GTC orders separately from ALO orders because ALO order-only batches are prioritized by the validators.
3. The trading logic tasks send orders and cancels to the batching task.
4. For each batch of orders or cancels, fetch and increment an atomic counter that ensures a unique nonce for the address. The atomic counter can be fast-forwarded to current unix milliseconds if needed.

This structure is robust to out-of-order transactions within 2 seconds, which should be sufficient for an automated strategy geographically near an API server.

### Suggestions for subaccount and vault users

Note that nonces are stored per signer, which is the address of the private key used to sign the transaction. Therefore, it's recommended that each trading process or frontend session use a separate private key for signing. In particular, a single API wallet signing for a user, vault, or subaccount all share the same nonce set.

If users want to use multiple subaccounts in parallel, it would easier to generate two separate API wallets under the master account, and use one API wallet for each subaccount. This avoids collisions between the nonce set used by each subaccount.


# Info endpoint

The info endpoint is used to fetch information about the exchange and specific users. The different request bodies result in different corresponding response body schemas.

### Pagination

Responses that take a time range will only return 500 elements or distinct blocks of data. To query larger ranges, use the last returned timestamp as the next `startTime` for pagination.

### Perpetuals vs Spot

The endpoints in this section as well as websocket subscriptions work for both Perpetuals and Spot. For perpetuals `coin` is the name returned in the `meta` response. For Spot, coin should be `PURR/USDC` for PURR, and `@{index}` e.g. `@1` for all other spot tokens where index is the index of the spot pair in the `universe` field of the `spotMeta` response. For example, the spot index for HYPE on mainnet is `@107` because the token index of HYPE is 150 and the spot pair `@107` has tokens `[150, 0]`. Note that some assets may be remapped on user interfaces. For example, `BTC/USDC` on app.hyperliquid.xyz corresponds to `UBTC/USDC` on mainnet HyperCore. The L1 name on the [token details page](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/explorer/token/0x8f254b963e8468305d409b33aa137c67) can be used to detect remappings.

### User address

To query the account data associated with a master or sub-account, you must pass in the actual address of that account. A common pitfall is to use an agent wallet's address which leads to an empty result.

# Exchange endpoint

The exchange endpoint is used to interact with and trade on the Hyperliquid chain. See the Python SDK for code to generate signatures for these requests.

### Asset

Many of the requests take asset as an input. For perpetuals this is the index in the `universe` field returned by the`meta` response. For spot assets, use `10000 + index` where `index` is the corresponding index in `spotMeta.universe`. For example, when submitting an order for `PURR/USDC`, the asset that should be used is `10000` because its asset index in the spot metadata is `0`.

### Subaccounts and vaults

Subaccounts and vaults do not have private keys. To perform actions on behalf of a subaccount or vault signing should be done by the master account and the vaultAddress field should be set to the address of the subaccount or vault. The basic\_vault.py example in the Python SDK demonstrates this.

### Expires After

Some actions support an optional field `expiresAfter` which is a timestamp in milliseconds after which the action will be rejected. User-signed actions such as Core USDC transfer do not support the `expiresAfter` field. Note that actions consume 5x the usual address-based rate limit when canceled due to a stale `expiresAfter` field.&#x20;

See the Python SDK for details on how to incorporate this field when signing.&#x20;

## Place an order

<mark style="color:green;">`POST`</mark> `https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/exchange`

See Python SDK for full featured examples on the fields of the order request.

For limit orders, TIF (time-in-force) sets the behavior of the order upon first hitting the book.

ALO (add liquidity only, i.e. "post only") will be canceled instead of immediately matching.

IOC (immediate or cancel) will have the unfilled part canceled instead of resting.

GTC (good til canceled) orders have no special behavior.

Client Order ID (cloid) is an optional 128 bit hex string, e.g. `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef`

Both `cancel` and `cancelByCloid` actions include an optional `fast` flag, encoded as `f` in the action. Orders with `f: true` are rejected if they refer to trigger orders. Currently `fast` has no other effect. In a future network upgrade, cancel actions will be prioritized in the mempool if and only if `fast = true`.

Note that `f` must be skipped if false, i.e. actions hashed with `f: false` will be rejected.&#x20;

Schedule a cancel-all operation at a future time. Not including time will remove the scheduled cancel operation. The time must be at least 5 seconds after the current time. Once the time comes, all open orders will be canceled and a trigger count will be incremented. The max number of triggers per day is 10. This trigger count is reset at 00:00 UTC.

Both single and batch modify actions include an optional `always_place` flag, encoded as `a` in the action. When `always_place = true` will place the new order regardless of whether the cancel succeeded. When `always_place = false` the new order must be a non-trigger order, and must have TIF = ALO or a non-executable order with TIF = GTC. In the latter case, TIF of the new order is overridden to ALO.

Note that `a` must be skipped if false, i.e. actions hashed with `a: false` will be rejected.&#x20;

## Send Asset

<mark style="color:green;">`POST`</mark> `https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/exchange`

This generalized method is used to transfer tokens between different perp DEXs, spot balance, users, and/or sub-accounts. Use "" to specify the default USDC perp DEX and "spot" to specify spot. Only the collateral token can be transferred to or from a perp DEX.

## Send to EVM with data

<mark style="color:green;">`POST`</mark> `https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/exchange`

Specialized action for Core to EVM transfer that includes an additional data payload. See [HyperCore <> HyperEVM transfers](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm/hypercore-less-than-greater-than-hyperevm-transfers) for more details. When used coreReceiveWithData will be called on the linked contract instead of transfer. IMPORTANT: it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the token is properly linked and the linked contract supports the following interface:<br>

```
interface ICoreReceiveWithData {
  function coreReceiveWithData(
    address from,
    bytes32 destinationRecipient,
    uint32 destinationChainId,
    uint256 amount,
    uint64 nonce,
    bytes calldata data
  ) external;
}
```

## Reserve Additional Actions

<mark style="color:green;">`POST`</mark> `https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/exchange`&#x20;

Instead of trading to increase the address based rate limits, this action allows reserving additional actions for 0.0005 USDC per request. The cost is paid from the Perps balance.&#x20;

`destination` may be set to pay for another L1 user. The destination user must already exist. This field is skipped in hashing if it is unset.

## Invalidate Pending Nonce (noop)

<mark style="color:green;">`POST`</mark> `https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/exchange`&#x20;

This action does not do anything (no operation), but causes the nonce to be marked as used. This can be a more effective way to cancel in-flight orders than the cancel action.

## Enable HIP-3 DEX abstraction

<mark style="color:green;">`POST`</mark> `https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/exchange`&#x20;

NOTE: deprecrated. Prefer `userSetAbstraction`.&#x20;

If set, actions on HIP-3 perps will automatically transfer collateral from validator-operated USDC perps balance for HIP-3 DEXs where USDC is the collateral token, and spot otherwise. When HIP-3 DEX abstraction is active, collateral is returned to the same source (validator-operated USDC perps or spot balance) when released from positions or open orders.

# Websocket

WebSocket endpoints are available for real-time data streaming and as an alternative to HTTP request sending on the Hyperliquid exchange. The WebSocket URLs by network are:

* Mainnet: `wss://api.hyperliquid.xyz/ws`&#x20;
* Testnet: `wss://api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/ws`.

### Connecting

To connect to the WebSocket API, establish a WebSocket connection to the respective URL based on the desired network. Once connected, you can start sending subscription messages to receive real-time data updates.

Example from command line:

```
$ wscat -c  wss://api.hyperliquid.xyz/ws
Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
>  { "method": "subscribe", "subscription": { "type": "trades", "coin": "SOL" } }
< {"channel":"subscriptionResponse","data":{"method":"subscribe","subscription":{"type":"trades","coin":"SOL"}}}
```

Important: all automated users should handle disconnects from the server side and gracefully reconnect. Disconnection from API servers may happen periodically and without announcement. Missed data during the reconnect will be present in the snapshot ack on reconnect. Users can also manually query any missed data using the corresponding info request.

Note: this doc uses Typescript for defining many of the message types. The python SDK also has examples [here](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/hyperliquid/utils/types.py) and example connection code [here](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/hyperliquid/websocket_manager.py).


# Subscriptions

This page describes subscribing to data streams using the WebSocket API.

### Subscription messages

To subscribe to specific data feeds, you need to send a subscription message. The subscription message format is as follows:

```json
{
  "method": "subscribe",
  "subscription": { ... }
}
```

The subscription ack provides a snapshot of previous data for time series data (e.g. user fills). These snapshot messages are tagged with `isSnapshot: true` and can be ignored if the previous messages were already processed.

The subscription object contains the details of the specific feed you want to subscribe to. Choose from the following subscription types and provide the corresponding properties:

1. `allMids`:
   * Subscription message: `{ "type": "allMids", "dex": "<dex>" }`
   * Data format: `AllMids`&#x20;
   * The `dex` field represents the perp dex to source mids from.
   * Note that the `dex` field is optional. If not provided, then the first perp dex is used. Spot mids are only included with the first perp dex.
2. `notification`:
   * Subscription message: `{ "type": "notification", "user": "<address>" }`

       `fflate.inflateSync` \
       3\. UTF-8 decode and parse as JSON\
       4\. Example to test your implementation\
       payload: `"q1ZyCnFWsqpWyk0syg6oULJSsjQ3NTDQM1Wq1VFyDfFAkTI2MzXQMwJLVVRWWfmFuTiiyBuamOoZKdXWAgA="`\
       decoded: `{ "BTC": { "markPx": "97500.5" }, "ETH": { "markPx": "3650.25" }, "xyz:NVDA": { markPx": "145.2" }}`
    4. The first message is a snapshot, subsequent messages contain only coins that have updated. Fields that have no updates are omitted.

### Data formats

The server will respond to successful subscriptions with a message containing the `channel` property set to `"subscriptionResponse"`, along with the `data` field providing the original subscription. The server will then start sending messages with the `channel` property set to the corresponding subscription type e.g. `"allMids"` and the `data` field providing the subscribed data.

The `data` field format depends on the subscription type:

* `AllMids`: All mid prices.
  * Format: `AllMids { mids: Record<string, string> }`
* `Notification`: A notification message.
  * Format: `Notification { notification: string }`
* `WebData2`: Aggregate information about a user, used primarily for the frontend.
  * Format: `WebData2`
* `WsTrade[]`: An array of trade updates.

Please note that the above data types are in TypeScript format, and their usage corresponds to the respective subscription types.

### Examples

Here are a few examples of subscribing to different feeds using the subscription messages:

1. Subscribe to all mid prices:

   ```json
   { "method": "subscribe", "subscription": { "type": "allMids" } }
   ```
2. Subscribe to notifications for a specific user:

   ```json
   { "method": "subscribe", "subscription": { "type": "notification", "user": "<address>" } }
   ```
3. Subscribe to web data for a specific user:

   ```json
   { "method": "subscribe", "subscription": { "type": "webData", "user": "<address>" } }
   ```
4. Subscribe to candle updates for a specific coin and interval:

   ```json
   { "method": "subscribe", "subscription": { "type": "candle", "coin": "<coin_symbol>", "interval": "<candle_interval>" } }
   ```
5. Subscribe to order book updates for a specific coin:

   ```json
   { "method": "subscribe", "subscription": { "type": "l2Book", "coin": "<coin_symbol>" } }
   ```
6. Subscribe to trades for a specific coin:

   ```json
   { "method": "subscribe", "subscription": { "type": "trades", "coin": "<coin_symbol>" } }
   ```

### Unsubscribing from WebSocket feeds

To unsubscribe from a specific data feed on the Hyperliquid WebSocket API, you need to send an unsubscribe message with the following format:

```json
{
  "method": "unsubscribe",
  "subscription": { ... }
}
```

The `subscription` object should match the original subscription message that was sent when subscribing to the feed. This allows the server to identify the specific feed you want to unsubscribe from. By sending this unsubscribe message, you inform the server to stop sending further updates for the specified feed.

Please note that unsubscribing from a specific feed does not affect other subscriptions you may have active at that time. To unsubscribe from multiple feeds, you can send multiple unsubscribe messages, each with the appropriate subscription details.


# Post requests

This page describes posting requests using the WebSocket API.

### Request format

The WebSocket API supports posting requests that you can normally post through the HTTP API. These requests are either info requests or signed actions. For examples of info request payloads, please refer to the Info endpoint section. For examples of signed action payloads, please refer to the Exchange endpoint section.

To send such a payload for either type via the WebSocket API, you must wrap it as such:

```json
{
  "method": "post",
  "id": <number>,
  "request": {
    "type": "info" | "action",
    "payload": { ... }
  }
}
```

Note: The `method` and `id` fields are mandatory. It is recommended that you use a unique `id` for every post request you send in order to track outstanding requests through the channel.

Note: `explorer` requests are not supported via WebSocket.

### Response format

The server will respond to post requests with either a success or an error. For errors, a `String` is returned mirroring the HTTP status code and description that would have been returned if the request were sent through HTTP.

```json
{
  "channel": "post",
  "data": {
    "id": <number>,
    "response": {
      "type": "info" | "action" | "error",
      "payload": { ... }
    }
  }
}
```

### Examples

Here are a few examples of subscribing to different feeds using the subscription messages:

Sending an L2Book info request:

```json
{
  "method": "post",
  "id": 123,
  "request": {
    "type": "info",
    "payload": {
      "type": "l2Book",
      "coin": "ETH",
      "nSigFigs": 5,
      "mantissa": null
    }
  }
}
```

Sample response:

```json
{
  "channel": "post",
  "data": {
    "id": <number>,
    "response": {
      "type": "info",
      "payload": {
        "type": "l2Book",
        "data": {
          "coin": "ETH",
          "time": <number>,
          "levels": [
            [{"px":"3007.1","sz":"2.7954","n":1}],
            [{"px":"3040.1","sz":"3.9499","n":1}]
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Sending an order signed action request:

```json
{
  "method": "post",
  "id": 256,
  "request": {
    "type": "action",
    "payload": {
      "action": {
        "type": "order",
        "orders": [{"a": 4, "b": true, "p": "1100", "s": "0.2", "r": false, "t": {"limit": {"tif": "Gtc"}}}],
        "grouping": "na"
      },
      "nonce": 1713825891591,
      "signature": {
        "r": "...",
        "s": "...",
        "v": "..."
      },
      "vaultAddress": "0x12...3"
    }
  }
}
```

Sample response:

```json
{
  "channel": "post",
  "data": {
    "id": 256,
    "response": {
      "type":"action",
      "payload": {
        "status": "ok",
        "response": {
          "type": "order",
          "data": {
            "statuses": [
              {
                "resting": {
                  "oid": 88383,
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


# Timeouts and heartbeats

This page describes the measures to keep WebSocket connections alive.

The server will close any connection if it hasn't sent a message to it in the last 60 seconds. If you are subscribing to a channel that doesn't receive messages every 60 seconds, you can send heartbeat messages to keep your connection alive. The format for these messages are:

```json
{ "method": "ping" }
```

The server will respond with:

```json
{ "channel": "pong" }
```


# Error responses

Order and cancel errors are usually returned as a vector with same length as the batched request.

Below is a list of possible batched error responses:

| Error source | Error type                        | Error string                                                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Order        | Tick                              | Price must be divisible by tick size.                                              |
| Order        | MinTradeNtl                       | Order must have minimum value of $10.                                              |
| Order        | MinTradeSpotNtl                   | Order must have minimum value of 10 {quote\_token}.                                |
| Order        | PerpMargin                        | Insufficient margin to place order.                                                |
| Order        | ReduceOnly                        | Reduce only order would increase position.                                         |
| Order        | BadAloPx                          | Post only order would have immediately matched, bbo was {bbo}.                     |
| Order        | IocCancel                         | Order could not immediately match against any resting orders.                      |
| Order        | BadTriggerPx                      | Invalid TP/SL price.                                                               |
| Order        | MarketOrderNoLiquidity            | No liquidity available for market order.                                           |
| Order        | PositionIncreaseAtOpenInterestCap | Order would increase open interest while open interest is capped                   |
| Order        | PositionFlipAtOpenInterestCap     | Order would increase open interest while open interest is capped                   |
| Order        | TooAggressiveAtOpenInterestCap    | Order rejected due to price more aggressive than oracle while at open interest cap |
| Order        | OpenInterestIncrease              | Order would increase open interest too quickly                                     |
| Order        | InsufficientSpotBalance           | (Spot-only) Order has insufficient spot balance to trade                           |
| Order        | Oracle                            | Order price too far from oracle                                                    |
| Order        | PerpMaxPosition                   | Order would cause position to exceed margin tier limit at current leverage         |
| Cancel       | MissingOrder                      | Order was never placed, already canceled, or filled.                               |

Important: Some errors are a deterministic function of the payload itself, and these are instead returned earlier as part of pre-validation. In this case only one error is returned for the entire payload, as some of these errors do not apply to a specific order or cancel.

Examples include: empty batch of orders, non-reduce-only TP/SL orders, order too far from reference price, and some forms of tick size validation.&#x20;

For API users that use batching, it's recommended to handle the case where a single error is returned for a batch of multiple orders. In this case, the response could be duplicated `n`times before being sent to the callback function, as the whole batch was rejected for this same reason.

For API users that use historical orders, a list of all the cancel / reject historical order statuses can be found [here](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/info-endpoint#query-order-status-by-oid-or-cloid).


# Signing

It is recommended to use an existing SDK instead of manually generating signatures. There are many potential ways in which signatures can be wrong. An incorrect signature results in recovering a different signer based on the signature and payload and results in one of the following errors:\
`"L1 error: User or API Wallet 0x0123... does not exist."`\
`Must deposit before performing actions. User: 0x123...`\
where the returned address does not match the public address of the wallet you are signing with. The returned address also changes for different inputs.\
An incorrect signature does not indicate why it is incorrect which makes debugging more challenging. To debug this it is recommended to read through the Python SDK carefully and make sure the implementation matches exactly. If that doesn't work, add logging to find where the output diverges.

Some common errors:\
1\. Not realizing that there are two signing schemes (the Python SDK methods are `sign_l1_action` vs `sign_user_signed_action`).\
2\. Not realizing that the order of fields matter for msgpack.\
3\. Issues with trailing zeroes on numbers.\
4\. Issues with upper case characters in address fields. It is recommended to lowercase any address before signing and sending. Sometimes the field is parsed as bytes, causing it to be lowercased automatically across the network.\
5\. Believing that the signature must be correct because calling recover signer locally results in the correct address. The payload for recover signer is constructed based on the action and does not necessarily match.


# Rate limits and user limits

The following rate limits apply per IP address:

* REST requests share an aggregated weight limit of 1200 per minute.&#x20;
  * All documented `exchange` API requests have a weight of `1 + floor(batch_length / 40)`. For example, unbatched actions have weight `1` and a batched order request of length 79 has weight `2`. Here, `batch_length`is the length of the array in the action, e.g. the number of orders in a batched order action.
  * The following `info` requests have weight 2: `l2Book, allMids, clearinghouseState, orderStatus, spotClearinghouseState, exchangeStatus.`
  * The following `info` requests have weight 60: `userRole` .
  * All other documented `info` requests have weight 20.&#x20;
  * The following `info` endpoints have an additional rate limit weight per 20 items returned in the response: `recentTrades`, `historicalOrders`, `userFills`, `userFillsByTime`, `fundingHistory`, `userFunding`, `nonUserFundingUpdates`, `twapHistory`, `userTwapSliceFills`, `userTwapSliceFillsByTime`, `delegatorHistory`, `delegatorRewards`, `validatorStats` .
  * The `candleSnapshot` info endpoint has an additional rate limit weight per 60 items returned in the response.
  * All `explorer` API requests have a weight of 40. `blockList` has an additional rate limit of 1 per block. Note that older blocks which have not been recently queried may be weighted more heavily. For large batch requests, use the S3 bucket instead.
* Maximum of 10 websocket connections
* Maximum of 30 new websocket connections per minute
* Maximum of 1000 websocket subscriptions
* Maximum of 10 unique users across user-specific websocket subscriptions
* Maximum of 2000 messages sent to Hyperliquid per minute across all websocket connections
* Maximum of 100 simultaneous inflight post messages across all websocket connections
* Maximum of 100 EVM JSON-RPC requests per minute for `rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm`. Note that other JSON-RPC providers have more sophisticated rate limiting logic and archive node functionality.&#x20;

Use websockets for lowest latency realtime data. See the python SDK for a full-featured example.

### Address-based limits

Address-based limits apply per user, with sub-accounts treated as separate users.

The rate limiting logic allows 1 request per 1 USDC traded cumulatively since address inception. For example, with an order value of 100 USDC, this requires a fill rate of 1%. Each address starts with an initial buffer of 10000 requests. When rate limited, an address is allowed one request every 10 seconds. Cancels have cumulative limit `min(limit + 100000, limit * 2)` where `limit` is the default limit for other actions. This way, hitting the address-based rate limit still allows open orders to be canceled. Note that this rate limit only applies to actions, not info requests.&#x20;

Each user has a default open order limit of 1000 plus one additional order for every 5M USDC of volume, capped at a total of 5000 open orders. When an order is placed with at least 1000 other open orders by the same user, it will be rejected if it is reduce-only or a trigger order.&#x20;

During high congestion, addresses are limited to use 2x their previous day maker share percentage of the block space. The maker share is scaled by the same factor as the volume contribution of that asset towards fee tiers. For example, HIP-3 assets under growth mode count less towards this rate limit. The maker share is computed once per UTC date. During high traffic, it can therefore be helpful to not resend cancels whose results have already been returned via the API.&#x20;

### Batched Requests

A batched request with `n` orders (or cancels) is treated as one request for IP based rate limiting, but as `n` requests for address-based rate limiting. &#x20;


# Activation gas fee

New HyperCore accounts require 1 quote token (e.g., 1 USDC, 1 USDT) of fees for the first transaction which has the new account as destination address. This applies regardless of the asset being transfered to the new account.&#x20;

Unactivated accounts cannot send CoreWriter actions. Contract deployers who do not want this one-time behavior could manually send an activation transaction to the EVM contract address on HyperCore.&#x20;


# Optimizing latency

The suggestions below are for informational purposes only and a non-comprehensive starting point. They are not trading advice and do not guarantee any latency or trading outcome.&#x20;

### Optimizing read latency (receiving market data)

1. Run a non-validating node against a reliable peer, such as Hyper Foundation non-validator.&#x20;
2. Run node with `--disable-output-file-buffering` to get outputs as soon as blocks are executed
3. Run node with sufficient machines specs, at least 32 logical cores, 128 GB RAM, and 500 MB/s disk throughput. Increasing cores can reduce latency because blocks will be faster to execute.
4. Construct book and other exchange state locally using outputs from node, which has faster and more granular data than the API. See <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/order_book_server> for an example on how to build an order book on the same machine that is running a node. This repo is not actively maintained. It is recommended to fork the repo or write an implementation from scratch to incorporate details such as ALO priority fees or other edge cases.
5. `--batch-by-block` on the node will wait until the end of the block to write the data. The example order book server above uses this to simplify logic, but a further optimization could include turning the flag off and inferring block boundaries otherwise.
6. Latency-sensitive users may find `split_client_blocks: true` useful, as it streams transactions to be committed before they are included in client blocks. This can lead to 70-150ms improvement in latency when reading inputs. As documented in the node repository, these are the fastest transaction inputs to execution, broadcast even before they are executed by the L1. The tradeoff with the faster input data is that the results from execution are not yet available. However, with simple actions like orders, the consumer can stream estimated account values for all users to predict execution results with reasonable accuracy.
7. The foundation non-validator is one of the highest uptime and low latency non-validator peers. See [here](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/nodes/foundation-non-validating-node) for details on access for latency-sensitive users. &#x20;
8. Read priority fees are the fastest way to read raw data from the network. See [here](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/priority-fees) for more details.&#x20;

### Optimizing write latency (sending orders and cancels)

1. Cancels should be sent with the [fast](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/exchange-endpoint#cancel-order-s) flag. There is no disadvantage to the fast flag, except that fast cancels cannot be used to cancel trigger orders.&#x20;
2. Write priority fees are the fastest way to send orders to the network. See [here](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/priority-fees) for more details.&#x20;
3. Hyperliquid's execution logic is designed to protect makers against toxic flow, so that end users see tight spreads and deep liquidity even during volatility. The primary driver of this effect is that cancels and ALO orders sent at time `t` will almost always execute before IOC and GTC orders sent at time `t`. This prioritization spans several blocks. The secondary effect is that each L1 block contains only a few consensus bundles. Within each bundle, ALO and cancels are executed before other transactions.&#x20;
4. End-to-end latency on Hyperliquid is not apples-to-apples with centralized matching engines, because the order book is fully onchain. End-to-end latency includes time to API server, mempool inclusion time, and time to commit (usually 2 blocks in pipelined HyperBFT consensus). The sequencing of transactions has far less noise than the end-to-end latency suggests. While a cancel or ALO order can show \~380ms end-to-end latency, users should be able to run experiments with <10ms variation between send times and see predictable ordering on the L1.&#x20;
5. Users who care to reduce the end-to-end write latency (for example to predict the sequence of transactions that will be committed) can read them from split client blocks in the non-validating node (see read latency section above). This approach does not include the execution result of the transaction.


# Priority fees

Advanced feature for latency-sensitive users

### Gossip (read) priority

There are 2 independent Dutch auctions synced to the same 3 minute schedule. The auction indices are optionally interpreted by nodes as an ordering for their peers when sending data. The priority ordering affects both split client blocks and normal client blocks that include responses. The foundation non-validator will opt into respecting the gossip priority auction ordering.&#x20;

The independent slot auctions are not additive, so an IP bidding multiple slots will be prioritized according to its lowest slot. For the auction to affect latency, the onchain IP must exactly match the IP seen by the peer sending data. Each auction's results only affect the duration of the following auction. For nodes that are connected via a chain of nodes to the validating network, note that each network hop may or may not respect the priority auction depending on how the parent node is configured.&#x20;

The lower auction indices are strictly prioritized over higher indices. The prioritization applies to all data in the mempool transactions stream equally. The ordering should be relatively consistent in expectation but is subject to variance from the p2p consensus network. Gossip priority applies only to reading data. For prioritization of sending data, see the section below on order priority. Nodes respecting gossip priority will use the previous auction winners relative to that node's current execution state. Similar to token, spot, and perp deployment auctions, fees come out of spot balance are burned.

The previous auction winners (i.e., current gossip priority ordering) and current auction statuses can be queried using the info request `{ "type": "gossipPriorityAuctionStatus"}`.&#x20;

Gossip priority reduces the need for market makers to hyper-optimize their infrastructure to remain competitive. To participate in the auction, users send action `{"type": "gossipPriorityBid", "slotId": 0, "ip": "1.2.3.4", "maxGas": 100000000}` where gas is wei (i.e. units of `0.00000001` HYPE) of HYPE charged from spot balance. Each auction resets to 10 times the previous winning price of that slot, and have a minimum price of `0.1 HYPE`. Any address may bid on behalf of any IP address.&#x20;

The current empirical effect of gossip priority on mainnet is approximately 25 ms reduction in latency per auction slot.

### Order (write) priority

Order priority reduces the need for market makers to hyper-optimize their order entry and connectivity, and instead focus on the strategy itself. It further protects makers and allows responsiveness to price moves driven by other venues.

Priority grouping is only supported for order actions where both

1. every order is on a non-outcome asset
2. every order is IOC, or every order is a non-reduce-only ALO

Orders can be sent with grouping of the form `{"p": 12345}` where the rate is interpreted as a fraction `p / 100000000.0`. The rate is charged from undelegated staking balance as a fraction of the filled notional in the case of IOC, and resting notional in the case of ALO. The priority gas charged is converted to HYPE using the spot mark price. &#x20;

#### IOC priority

The priority rate has a linear effect on end-to-end latency from 0-8bps, i.e. `p = 80000`. The current empirical effect of order priority fees on mainnet is approximately 45 ms reduction in end-to-end latency per 1 bp of priority fee paid. Even with order priority, all cancels are prioritized before all immediately executable orders. However, higher priority orders are prioritized before lower priority orders as a linear function of priority rate.&#x20;

The max priority rate is 100%. Any priority between 8bps and 100% is treated with identical time preference in the mempool. However, IOC orders with at least 8bps priority fee that would be executed by the block proposer in each 70ms unix time bucket (usually corresponding to 1 block) are sorted in decreasing order of priority fee. In other words, the 0-8bps range effects temporal prioritization, and 8bps-100% range breaks ties among orders in this range received at a similar time. As a concrete example, if the unix milliseconds boundary is `(T, T + 70ms)` , the orders with `(mempool_receive_time, priority)` equal to `(T, 8bps)`, `(T + 30ms, 9bps)`, `(T + 69ms, 10bps)` would be sorted in reverse order of receive time.

Although blocks are discrete, order prioritization is continuous with respect to order write priority fee. The mempool transactions are effectively sorted by `effective_time = arrival_time + f(action, priority_fee)` where `f` is a strictly decreasing function of priority fee, and zero for prioritized actions such as cancels. For a given action type, boundaries between blocks are not relevant for relative prioritization, as the transactions within a block are still sorted according to `effective_time` .

Order priority applies only to sending data. For prioritization of reading data, see the previous section on gossip priority. Similar to gossip priority auctions, order priority fees are burned.

IOC priority fee paid can be read from the `user_fills` file written by the nodes as field `priorityGas` .

#### ALO priority&#x20;

On the timescale of `T = 400ms`, ALO orders are sorted by priority. More precisely, the tail of the queue at each level consisting of orders placed within the past `T` will be sorted in decreasing order of priority rate.&#x20;

As a consequence, any slot in the queue is eligible for priority fee bidding for a window of duration `T`.  Each new order compares against the tail of orders less than `T` old at placement time. In other words, the `T` window is continuous, not bucketed. ALO priority fees are deducted at time of placing the order regardless of whether the order fills.&#x20;

Unlike for IOC orders, ALO priority fees do not effect mempool prioritization. ALO orders are processed FIFO as transactions always, with similar end-to-end latency as cancels. The priority fee implementation affects place in queue across transactions. In other words, ALO orders are prioritized similarly in the mempool regardless of their priority, but queue position can change on a 400ms time scale after orders transactions are executed on the L1.

A concrete example: a new level `L` opens and is empty at time `t`. The first order  `A`  at level `L` is applied onchain (as above, this means executed on the L1) at time `t' > t` with zero priority fee. The next order `B` is applied onchain at time `t' + T - 1ms` with priority `p > 0`. Assuming `A` and `B` are the only orders at level `L`, the ordering at time `t' + T` will have `B` in front of `A`. A third order `C` is applied at time `t' + T + 1ms` with priority `p' > p`. The ordering at time `t' + T + 1ms` is `B > A > C` . Even though `C` has higher priority, `B` has already locked in its place in queue because `A` has been on the book for `T`, and `B` sits before `A`. &#x20;

Gossip priority fees can be read from the `replica_cmds` files recorded by nodes. The USDC value of the priority fee amounts can be computed as `order_price * order_sz * grouping_priority_rate` . The [order\_book\_server](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/order_book_server) maintains the correct level ordering by using the `insertBefore` field on `RawBookDiff::New` from the `raw_book_diff` files.


# USDC

CCTP is the preferred method for minting USDC natively on the Hyperliquid L1. See <https://github.com/circlefin/hyperevm-circle-contracts> for Circle's published contracts and flows.

### Legacy Bridge

CCTP supports more chains and functionality. The legacy bridge is deprecated.

Contract: <https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2df1c51e09aecf9cacb7bc98cb1742757f163df7>

Source: <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/contracts/blob/master/Bridge2.sol>

#### Deposit

The deposit flow for the bridge is simple. The user sends native USDC to the bridge, and it is credited to the account that sent it in less than 1 minute. The minimum deposit amount is 5 USDC. If you send an amount less than this, it will not be credited and be lost forever.&#x20;

#### Withdraw

The withdrawal flow requires a user wallet signature on Hyperliquid only, and no Arbitrum transaction. The withdrawal from Arbitrum is handled entirely by validators, and the funds arrive in the user wallet in 3-4 minutes. This payload for signTypedData is

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]
pub(crate) struct WithdrawAction3 {
    pub(crate) signature_chain_id: U256,
    pub(crate) hyperliquid_chain: Chain,
    pub(crate) destination: String,
    pub(crate) amount: String,
    pub(crate) time: u64,
}

impl Eip712 for WithdrawAction3 {
    type Error = Eip712Error;

    fn domain(&self) -> StdResult<EIP712Domain, Self::Error> {
        Ok(eip_712_domain(self.signature_chain_id))
    }

    fn type_hash() -> StdResult<[u8; 32], Self::Error> {
        Ok(eip712::make_type_hash(
            format!("{HYPERLIQUID_EIP_PREFIX}Withdraw"),
            &[
                ("hyperliquidChain".to_string(), ParamType::String),
                ("destination".to_string(), ParamType::String),
                ("amount".to_string(), ParamType::String),
                ("time".to_string(), ParamType::Uint(64)),
            ],
        ))
    }

    fn struct_hash(&self) -> StdResult<[u8; 32], Self::Error> {
        let Self { signature_chain_id: _, hyperliquid_chain, destination, amount, time } = self;
        let items = vec![
            ethers::abi::Token::Uint(Self::type_hash()?.into()),
            encode_eip712_type(hyperliquid_chain.to_string().into_token()),
            encode_eip712_type(destination.clone().into_token()),
            encode_eip712_type(amount.clone().into_token()),
            encode_eip712_type(time.into_token()),
        ];
        Ok(keccak256(encode(&items)))
    }
}
```

Example signed Hyperliquid action:

```json
{
    "action": {
        "type": "withdraw3",
        "signatureChainId": "0xa4b1",
        "hyperliquidChain": "Mainnet" or "Testnet" 
        "destination": "0x000....0",
        "amount": "12.3",
        "time": 1698693262
    },
    "nonce": 1698693262 // IMPORTANT: this must match "time",
    "signature": {"r": ..., "s": ..., "v": ... } // signedTypedData output based on Eip712 implementation above. See python sdk for equivalent python code
}
```

#### Deposit with permit

The bridge supports depositing on behalf of another user via the `batchedDepositWithPermit`function. Example code for how the user can sign the PermitPayload

```typescript
const payload: PermitPayload = {
  owner, // The address of the user with funds they want to deposit
  spender, // The address of the bridge 0x2df1c51e09aecf9cacb7bc98cb1742757f163df7 on mainnet and 0x08cfc1B6b2dCF36A1480b99353A354AA8AC56f89 on testnet
  value,
  nonce,
  deadline,
};

const isMainnet = true;

const domain = {
  name: isMainnet ? "USD Coin" : "USDC2",
  version: isMainnet ? "2" : "1",
  chainId: isMainnet ? 42161 : 421614,
  verifyingContract: isMainnet ? "0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831" : "0x1baAbB04529D43a73232B713C0FE471f7c7334d5",
};

const permitTypes = {
  Permit: [
    { name: "owner", type: "address" },
    { name: "spender", type: "address" },
    { name: "value", type: "uint256" },
    { name: "nonce", type: "uint256" },
    { name: "deadline", type: "uint256" },
  ],
};

const dataToSign = {
  domain,
  types: permitTypes,
  primaryType: "Permit",
  message: payload,
} as const;

const data = await walletClient.signTypedData(dataToSign);
const signature = splitSig(data);
```

#### Open interest caps

Builder-deployed perp markets are subject to two types of open interest caps: notional (sum of absolute position size times mark price) and size (sum of absolute position sizes).

Notional open interest caps are enforced on the total open interest summed over all assets within the DEX, as well as per-asset. Perp deployers can set a custom open interest cap per asset, which is documented in <https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/hip-3-deployer-actions>.

Size-denominated open interest caps are only enforced per-asset. Size-denominated open interest caps are currently a constant 1B per asset, so a reasonable default would be to set `szDecimals` such that the minimal size increment is $1-10 at the initial mark price.


# HIP-4 deployer actions

Testnet-only

#### Overview

To ensure markets are high quality and well-defined, validators vote on outcome templates, which HIP-4 deployers use as the basis for permissionless deployments. Templates fix the structure of the specification's display text, side names, and the set of typed keywords.

Deploying has no gas cost. Capacity is instead bounded by per-deployer limits (see Limits).

#### Action format

The following actions are involved in deployment:

```json
{ "type": "activateOutcomeDeployer", "activate": { "venueName": <venue> } }
{ "type": "activateOutcomeDeployer", "deactivate": null }
{ "type": "spotDeploy", "outcome": { "<variant>": { ...variant fields... } } }
```

* Outcomes and questions are referenced by the numeric index assigned at creation, e.g. `"outcome": 7`.
* **Venue name**: 2–4 lowercase ASCII letters, subject to the same rules as HIP-3 perp DEX names. The name must be unique across the venue names of all deployers — including deactivated ones, whose names stay reserved — and must not match an existing perp DEX name (nor `spot`). Conversely, a registered venue name cannot be claimed by a later perp DEX deployment.
* As with HIP-3, all lists of tuples should be lexicographically sorted before signing
* `keywordToValue` is a sorted list of tuples mapping each template keyword to its value. For example, `[["expiry","20260801-0600"],["target","100"],["underlying","ABC"]]`.
* Name-and-description values are two-element arrays: `["<name>", "<description>"]`.
* `sideNames` arrays are `["<YES side name>", "<NO side name>"]`.
* Amounts and settlement fractions are decimal strings (`"1"`, `"0.25"`).

#### Activation

`activateOutcomeDeployer` is an enum with `activate` and `deactivate` variants:

```json
{ "type": "activateOutcomeDeployer", "activate": { "venueName": "ab" } }
{ "type": "activateOutcomeDeployer", "deactivate": null }
```

* **Staking requirement**: active deployers must maintain the staking requirement for as long as it remains an outcome deployer. Requirements stack with the deployer's other staking requirements. For example, stake that counts towards HIP-3 deployment does not double-count towards outcome deployment.
* Deployers must use Standard account abstraction.

Deactivation requires that the minimum deployer staking duration (183 days) has elapsed and that the deployer has no active outcomes. Deactivation is permanent: the account cannot activate again, and its venue name stays reserved.

#### Templates

Every deployer-created market comes from a template. A template has one of three roles:

* **Standalone outcome**: deploys a single YES/NO market; the template fixes the side names.
* **Question**: deploys a question (the container).
* **Question outcome**: deploys one outcome of a question; each question-outcome template declares its parent question template, and instantiations are only accepted under that parent.

A template fixes display name and description text containing `{keyword}` placeholders (e.g., `"{underlying} above {target} at {expiry}"`) together with a typed `hint` per keyword. An instantiation supplies exactly one value per keyword.

Keyword value formats by hint type:

| Hint          | Value format                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dateTime`    | `%Y%m%d-%H%M`, e.g. `"20260712-1830"`; must be within the next year                         |
| `date`        | `YYYYMMDD`, e.g. `"20260712"` (end of day); must be within the next year                    |
| `string`      | free text                                                                                   |
| `shortString` | free text of at most 10 characters                                                          |
| `hlPerp`      | coin name of an existing perp, e.g. `"ABC"` or `"test:ABC"`                                 |
| `uInt`        | nonnegative integer that fits in a u64, e.g. `"250"` (no sign or leading zeros)             |
| `uDecimal`    | nonnegative decimal, e.g. `"0.5"` or `"250"` (no sign, exponent, or leading/trailing zeros) |

Values are at most 100 characters and cannot contain `{`, `}`, or `|` (`:` is allowed, e.g. for HIP-3 coin names).

The onchain outcome descriptions are derived from the instantiation:

* **Name**: `template:<template_id>`, e.g. `template:aaa`. The `template:` prefix is reserved. Only template deployments can produce it.
* **Description**: the keyword-value pairs sorted by keyword and joined as `keyword:value|keyword:value`, e.g. `expiry:20260801-0600|target:100|underlying:BTC`.
* **Side names**: for standalone outcomes, `template:` plus the template's side names (e.g. `template:Over` / `template:Under`); question outcomes use the defaults `Yes` / `No`.
* **Question fallback**: named `template fallback` with description `other` and side names `Yes` / `No`.

#### Deployer fee scale

Template instances (`registerStandaloneOutcomeFromTemplate` and the `questionTemplateInstance` of `registerQuestionFromTemplate`) carry a required `deployerFeeScale`, a decimal string in `[0, 10]` (`Deployer fee scale cannot be negative or greater than 10.`).

* Users trading the outcome's markets pay the base outcome trading fee rate times `scale + max(scale, 1)`: the deployer receives the `scale` component and the protocol the rest. With `"0"`, users pay the base rate and the deployer receives nothing. Maker rebates are never paid on outcome markets.
* A question's scale applies uniformly to its fallback and every question outcome, including ones associated later; question outcome template instances carry no scale of their own.
* Per-outcome scales are returned in the `outcomeMeta` info request.

Examples, expressed as multiples of the user's base outcome trading fee rate:

| `deployerFeeScale` | Total user fee | Deployer receives | Protocol receives |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `"1"`              | 2x             | 1x                | 1x                |
| `"3"`              | 6x             | 3x                | 3x                |
| `"10"`             | 20x            | 10x               | 10x               |
| `"0.5"`            | 1.5x           | 0.5x              | 1x                |
| `"0.25"`           | 1.25x          | 0.25x             | 1x                |
| `"0"`              | 1x             | 0x                | 1x                |

#### Action reference

The `outcome` family of `spotDeploy` has five deployer variants.

**`registerStandaloneOutcomeFromTemplate`**

Deploys a standalone YES/NO market from a standalone outcome template.

```json
{
  "type": "spotDeploy",
  "outcome": {
    "registerStandaloneOutcomeFromTemplate": {
      "id": "abc",
      "keywordToValue": [
        ["expiry", "20260801-0600"],
        ["target", "100"],
        ["underlying", "ABC"]
      ],
      "deployerFeeScale": "1"
    }
  }
}
```

**`registerQuestionFromTemplate`**

Deploys a question and its question outcomes in one action.

```json
{
  "type": "spotDeploy",
  "outcome": {
    "registerQuestionFromTemplate": {
      "questionTemplateInstance": {
        "id": "abc",
        "keywordToValue": [["expiry", "20260801-1830"]],
        "deployerFeeScale": "1"
      },
      "namedOutcomeTemplateInstances": [
        { "id": "abc-outcome", "keywordToValue": [["choice", "A"]] },
        { "id": "abc-outcome", "keywordToValue": [["choice", "B"]] },
        { "id": "abc-other", "keywordToValue": [] }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

* Each question outcome template must declare the question template as its parent. The same question outcome template may be instantiated multiple times with different values.
* A question with N question outcomes registers N + 1 outcomes (the fallback is created automatically). All count toward the deployer's active-outcome cap.
* More question outcomes can be added to the live question with `registerAndAssociateNamedOutcomeFromTemplate`. Bounded to at most 100 question outcomes per question.

**`registerAndAssociateNamedOutcomeFromTemplate`**

Adds one question outcome to a live question of the deployer.

```json
{
  "type": "spotDeploy",
  "outcome": {
    "registerAndAssociateNamedOutcomeFromTemplate": {
      "question": 3,
      "namedOutcomeTemplateInstance": { "id": "abc-outcome", "keywordToValue": [["choice", "C"]] }
    }
  }
}
```

* The question must have been deployed from a template, and the question outcome template must declare the question's template as its parent.
* The new outcome inherits the question's `deployerFeeScale` and counts toward the deployer's active-outcome and daily caps.
* Holders of the question's fallback YES token receive an equal balance of the new outcome's YES token, so existing "other" positions keep their meaning.

**`settleOutcome`**

Settles one outcome of the deployer.

```json
{
  "type": "spotDeploy",
  "outcome": {
    "settleOutcome": {
      "outcome": 7,
      "settleFraction": "1",
      "details": "",
      "nameAndDescription": ["template:abc", "expiry:20260801-0600|target:100|underlying:ABC"],
      "sideNames": ["template:Over", "template:Under"]
    }
  }
}
```

* `nameAndDescription` and `sideNames` must exactly match the outcome being settled.
* `settleFraction` is a decimal in `[0, 1]`. Standalone outcomes may settle to any fraction (e.g. `"0.66"` for scalar payouts); outcomes that belong to a question must settle to exactly `"0"` or `"1"`.
* `details` must be empty.
* For question outcomes, settlement is sequential: question outcomes may settle to `"0"` in any order. A single outcome settles to `"1"` after it is the last active question outcome, which automatically settles the fallback to 0 and settles the question.

**`settleQuestion2`**

Settles all remaining question outcomes of a question in one action. Note: The original `settleQuestion` variant is discontinued.

```json
{
  "type": "spotDeploy",
  "outcome": {
    "settleQuestion2": {
      "question": 3,
      "outcomeSettlements": [
        {
          "outcome": 11,
          "settleFraction": "1",
          "details": "",
          "nameAndDescription": ["template:abc-outcome", "choice:A"],
          "sideNames": ["Yes", "No"]
        },
        {
          "outcome": 12,
          "settleFraction": "0",
          "details": "",
          "nameAndDescription": ["template:abc-outcome", "choice:B"],
          "sideNames": ["Yes", "No"]
        }
      ],
      "nameAndDescription": ["template:abc", "expiry:20260801-1830"]
    }
  }
}
```

* `outcomeSettlements` must cover exactly the question's remaining active question outcomes, with exactly one settling to `"1"` and all others to `"0"`. The fallback settles to 0 automatically.

#### Read API

* `{"type": "outcomeMeta"}` info request includes non-null outcome deployers.
* `{"type": "outcomeTemplates"}` info request returns all templates.

#### Limits

* At most `N` active outcomes per deployer (N=10 on testnet). Settling outcomes frees capacity.
* A deployer can deploy `M` outcomes per day (M=50 on testnet).

## Open interest caps

Builder-deployed perp markets are subject to two types of open interest caps: notional (sum of absolute position size times mark price) and size (sum of absolute position sizes).&#x20;

Notional open interest caps are enforced on the total open interest summed over all assets within the DEX, as well as per-asset. Perp deployers can set a custom open interest cap per asset, which is documented in <https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/hip-3-deployer-actions>.

Size-denominated open interest caps are only enforced per-asset. Size-denominated open interest caps are currently a constant 1B per asset, so a reasonable default would be to set `szDecimals` such that the minimal size increment is $1-10 at the initial mark price.


# HyperEVM

The HyperEVM consists of EVM blocks built as part of Hyperliquid's execution, inheriting all security from HyperBFT consensus. HYPE is the native gas token on the HyperEVM. To move HYPE from HyperCore to HyperEVM, send HYPE to `0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222`. See the instructions in [Native Transfers](/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm/hypercore-less-than-greater-than-hyperevm-transfers) for more details on how this works.

Note that there are currently no official frontend components of the EVM. Users can build their own frontends or port over existing EVM applications. All interaction with the EVM happens through the JSON-RPC. For example, users can add the chain to their wallets by entering the RPC URL and chain ID. There is currently no websocket JSON-RPC support for the RPC at `rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm`but other RPC implementations may support it.

The HyperEVM uses the Cancun hardfork without blobs. In particular, EIP-1559 is enabled on the HyperEVM. Base fees are burned as usual, implemented in the standard way where the burned fees are removed from the total EVM supply. Unlike most other EVM chains, priority fees are also burned because the HyperEVM uses HyperBFT consensus. The burned priority fees are sent to the zero address's EVM balance.&#x20;

On both mainnet and testnet, HYPE on the HyperEVM has 18 decimals. A few differences between testnet and mainnet HyperEVM are highlighted below:

### Mainnet

Chain ID: 999

JSON-RPC endpoint: `https://rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm` for mainnet&#x20;

### Testnet

Chain ID: 998&#x20;

JSON-RPC endpoint: `https://rpc.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/evm`


# Dual-block architecture

The total HyperEVM throughput is split between small blocks produced at a fast rate and large blocks produced at a slower rate.&#x20;

The primary motivation behind the dual-block architecture is to decouple block speed and block size when allocating throughput improvements. Users want faster blocks for lower time to confirmation. Builders want larger blocks to include larger transactions such as more complex contract deployments. Instead of a forced tradeoff, the dual-block system will allow simultaneous improvement along both axes.&#x20;

The HyperEVM "mempool" is still onchain state with respect to the umbrella L1 execution, but is split into two independent mempools that source transactions for the two block types. The two block types are interleaved with a unique increasing sequence of EVM block numbers. The onchain mempool implementation accepts only the next 8 nonces for each address. Transactions older than 1 day old in the mempool are pruned.&#x20;

The initial configuration is set conservatively, and throughput is expected to increase over successive technical upgrades. Fast block duration is set to 1 seconds with a 3M gas limit. Slow block duration is set to 1 minute with a 30M gas limit.&#x20;

More precisely, in the definitions above, *block duration* of `x` means that the first L1 block for each value   of `l1_block_time % x` produces an EVM block.&#x20;

Developers can deploy larger contracts as follows:

1. Submit action `{"type": "evmUserModify", "usingBigBlocks": true}` to direct HyperEVM transactions to big blocks instead of small blocks. Note that this user state flag is set on the HyperCore user level, and must be unset again to target small blocks. Like any action, this requires an existing Core user to send. Like any EOA, the deployer address can be converted to a Core user by receiving a Core asset such as USDC.
2. Optionally use the JSON-RPC method `bigBlockGasPrice` in place of `gasPrice` to estimate base gas fee on the next big block.


# Raw HyperEVM block data

Builders running a non-validating node can index the HyperEVM using data written to `~/hl/data/evm_block_and_receipts` . This data is written after committed blocks are verified by the node, and therefore has no additional trust assumptions compared to running the EVM RPC directly from the node itself.

Builders that wish to index the HyperEVM without running a node can use the S3 bucket: `aws s3 ls s3://hl-mainnet-evm-blocks/ --request-payer requester`.&#x20;

There is a similar bucket `s3://hl-testnet-evm-blocks/` for testnet.

Builders interested in robustness can merge the two data sources, relying primarily on local data and falling back to S3 data.

Some potential applications include a JSON-RPC server with custom rate limits, a HyperEVM block explorer, or other indexed services and tooling for builders.

While the data is public for anyone to use, the requester must pay for data transfer costs. The filenames are predictably indexed by EVM block number, e.g. `s3://hl-mainnet-evm-blocks/0/6000/6123.rmp.lz4.` An indexer can copy block data from S3 on new HyperEVM blocks. The files are stored in MessagePack format and then compressed using LZ4.

Note that testnet starts with directory `s3://hl-testnet-evm-blocks/18000000`and the earlier testnet RPC blocks were not backfilled.

An example can be found in the Python SDK: <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/evm_block_indexer.py>


# Interacting with HyperCore

### Read precompiles

The testnet EVM provides read precompiles that allows querying HyperCore information. The precompile addresses start at  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000800 and have methods for querying information such as perps positions, spot balances, vault equity, staking delegations, oracle prices, and the L1 block number.

The values are guaranteed to match the latest HyperCore state at the time the EVM block is constructed.

Attached is a Solidity file `L1Read.sol` describing the read precompiles. As an example, this call queries the third perp oracle price on testnet:

```
cast call 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000807 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003 --rpc-url https://rpc.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/evm
```

To convert to floating point numbers, divide the returned price by `10^(6 - szDecimals)`for perps and `10^(8 - base asset szDecimals)` for spot.

Precompiles called on invalid inputs such as invalid assets or vault address will return an error and consume all gas passed into the precompile call frame. Precompiles have a gas cost of `2000 + 65 * (input_len + output_len)`.

### CoreWriter contract

A system contract is available at 0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333 for sending transactions from the HyperEVM to HyperCore. It burns \~25,000 gas before emitting a log to be processed by HyperCore as an action. In practice the gas usage for a basic call will be \~47000. A solidity file `CoreWriter.sol` for the write system contract is attached.

#### Action encoding details

* Byte 1: Encoding version
  * Currently, only version `1` is supported, but enables future upgrades while maintaining backward compatibility.
* Bytes 2-4: Action ID
  * These three bytes, when decoded as a big-endian unsigned integer, represent the unique identifier for the action.
* Remaining bytes: Action encoding
  * The rest of the bytes constitue the action-specific data. It is always the raw ABI encoding of a sequence of Solidity types

To prevent any potential latency advantages for using HyperEVM to bypass the L1 mempool, order actions and vault transfers sent from CoreWriter are delayed onchain for a few seconds. This has no noticeable effect on UX because the end user has to wait for at least one small block confirmation. These onchain-delayed actions appear twice in the L1 explorer: first as an enqueuing and second as a HyperCore execution.

Below is an example contract that would send an action on behalf of its own contract address on HyperCore, which also demonstrates one way to construct the encoded action in Solidity.

contract CoreWriterCaller {

        bytes memory encodedAction = abi.encode(ntl, toPerp);
        bytes memory data = new bytes(4 + encodedAction.length);
        data[0] = 0x01;
        data[1] = 0x00;
        data[2] = 0x00;
        data[3] = 0x07;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodedAction.length; i++) {
            data[4 + i] = encodedAction[i];
        }
        CoreWriter(0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333).sendRawAction(data);
    }
}
```

Happy building. Any feedback is appreciated.

# HyperCore <> HyperEVM transfers

## Introduction

Spot assets can be sent between HyperCore and the HyperEVM. In the context of these transfers, spot assets on HyperCore are called `Core spot` while ones on the EVM are called `EVM spot`. The spot deployer can link their Core spot asset to any ERC20 contract deployed to the EVM. The Core spot asset and ERC20 token can be deployed in either order.

As the native token on HyperCore, HYPE also links to the native HyperEVM balance rather than an ERC20 contract.

## System Addresses

Every token has a system address on the Core, which is the address with first byte `0x20` and the remaining bytes all zeros, except for the token index encoded in big-endian format. For example, for token index 200, the system address would be `0x20000000000000000000000000000000000000c8` .

The exception is HYPE, which has a system address of `0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222` .

## Transferring HYPE

HYPE is a special case as the native gas token on the HyperEVM. HYPE is received on the EVM side of a transfer as the native gas token instead of an ERC20 token. To transfer back to HyperCore, HYPE can be sent as a transaction value. The EVM transfer address `0x222..2` is a system contract that emits `event Received(address indexed user, uint256 amount)` as its payable `receive()` function. Here `user` is `msg.sender`, so this implementation enables both smart contracts and EOAs to transfer HYPE back to HyperCore. Note that there is a small gas cost to emitting this log on the EVM side.

## Transferring between Core and EVM

Only once a token is linked, it can be converted between HyperCore and HyperEVM spot using a sendAsset action (or via the frontend) and on the EVM by using an ERC20 transfer.

Transferring tokens from HyperCore to HyperEVM can be done using a sendAsset action (or via the frontend) with the corresponding system address as the destination. The tokens are credited by a system transaction that calls `transfer(recipient, amount)` on the linked contract as the system address, where recipient is the sender of the sendAsset action.&#x20;

Transferring tokens from HyperEVM to HyperCore can be done using an ERC20 transfer with the corresponding system address as the destination. The tokens are credited to the Core based on the emitted `Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 value)` from the linked contract.

Do not blindly assume accurate fungibility between Core and EVM spot. See [#caveats](#caveats "mention") for more details.

## Gas costs

A transfer from HyperEVM to HyperCore costs similar gas to the equivalent transfer of the ERC20 token or HYPE to any other address on the HyperEVM that has an existing balance.

A transfer from HyperCore to HyperEVM costs 200k gas at the base gas price of the next HyperEVM block.

## Linking Core and EVM Spot Assets

In order for transfers between Core spot and EVM spot to work the token's system address must have the total non-system balance on the other side. For example, to deploy an ERC20 contract for an existing Core spot asset, the system contract should have the entirety of the EVM spot supply equal to the max Core spot supply.\
\
Once this is done the spot deployer needs to send a spot deploy action to link the token to the EVM:

```javascript
/**
 * @param token - The token index to link
 * @param address - The address of the ERC20 contract on the evm.
 * @param evmExtraWeiDecimals - The difference in Wei decimals between Core and EVM spot. E.g. Core PURR has 5 weiDecimals but EVM PURR has 18, so this would be 13. evmExtraWeiDecimals should be in the range [-2, 18] inclusive
 */
interface RequestEvmContract {
  type: “requestEvmContract”;
  token: number;
  Address: address;
  evmExtraWeiDecimals: number;
}
```

After sending this action, HyperCore will store the pending EVM address to be linked. The deployer of the EVM contract must then verify their intention to link to the HyperCore token in one of two ways:

1. If the EVM contract was deployed from an EOA, the EVM user can send an action using the nonce that was used to deploy the EVM contract.
2. If the EVM contract was deployed by another contract (e.g. create2 via a multisig), the contract's first storage slot or slot at keccak256("HyperCore deployer") must store the address of a finalizer user.

To finalize the link, the finalizer user sends the following action (note that this not nested in a spot deploy action). In the "create" case, the EVM deployer sends the action. In the "firstStorageSlot" or "customStorageSlot" case, the finalizer must match the value in the corresponding slot.

```javascript
/**
 * @param input - One of the EVM deployer options above
 */
interface FinalizeEvmContract {
  type: “finalizeEvmContract”;
  token: number;
  input: {"create": {"nonce": number}} | "firstStorageSlot" | "customStorageSlot"};
}
```

## Caveats

There are currently no checks that the system address has sufficient supply or that the contract is a valid ERC20, so be careful when sending funds.

In particular, the linked contract may have arbitrary bytecode, so it's prudent to verify that its implementation is correct. There are no guarantees about what the `transfer` call does on the EVM, so make sure to verify the source code and total balance of the linked EVM contract.&#x20;

If the EVM contract has extra Wei decimals, then if the relevant log emitted has a value that is not round (does not end in `extraEvmWeiDecimals` zeros), the non-round amount is burned (guaranteed to be <1 Wei). This is true for both HYPE and any other spot tokens.

## Mainnet PURR

Mainnet PURR is deployed as an ERC20 contract at `0x9b498C3c8A0b8CD8BA1D9851d40D186F1872b44E` with the following code. It will be linked to PURR on HyperCore once linking is enabled on mainnet.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.28;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Permit.sol";

contract Purr is ERC20Permit {
    constructor() ERC20("Purr", "PURR") ERC20Permit("Purr") {
        address initialHolder = 0x2000000000000000000000000000000000000001;
        uint256 initialBalance = 600000000;

        _mint(initialHolder, initialBalance * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```

## Final Notes

Attached is a sample script for deploying an ERC20 token to the EVM and linking it to a Core spot token.

# Interaction timings

## Transfer Timing

Transfers from HyperCore to HyperEVM are queued on the L1 until the next HyperEVM block. Transfers from HyperEVM to HyperCore happen in the same L1 block as the HyperEVM block, immediately after the HyperEVM block is built.

## Timing within a HyperEVM block

On an L1 block that produces a HyperEVM block:

1. L1 block is built
2. EVM block is built
3. EVM -> Core transfers are processed&#x20;
4. CoreWriter actions are processed&#x20;

Note that the account performing the CoreWriter action must exist on HyperCore before the EVM block is built. An EVM -> Core transfer to initialize the account in the same block will still result in the CoreWriter action being rejected.
